The Buddha's Words works well on a tablet or PC but is a bit difficult to read on smaller smart phone-sized screens. It has been tested on a range of browsers but has been developed and maintained on Google Chrome.  The Buddha's Words relies on javascript to load pages, toggle Pali on and off and to do the Pali lookup etc.

Venerable Nyanamagga has let The Buddha's Words team know about Kiwix, a free program dedicated to providing offline access to free educational content (To learn more see here: https://kiwix.org/en/about-us/.
