The Buddhas Words works well on a tablet or PC but is a bit difficult to read on smaller smart phone-sized screens. It has been tested on a range of browsers but has been developed and maintained on Google Chrome. Other browsers, such as the ones pre-installed on Android devices, generally do not work as they don't support javascript. The Buddha's Words relies on javascript to load pages, toggle Pali on and off and to do the Pali lookup etc.

It is easy to run on any Windows computer and on any Mac OSX device. By following the instructions below, it is relatively easy to run on any Android or IOS device such as iPads and iPhones.

1. Location of the Files.
The latest versions of The Buddha's Words are shared here: https://tinyurl.com/y4gzyhgt on Google Drive. There are archives in both zip and 7-zip format. Both contain an identical collection of files however the zip archive is larger (around 23Mb) and easiest to use. The 7-zip archive is significantly smaller at around 10Mb but not as easy to use or as ubiquitous as zip archives.

2. Installing onto a Windows Computer.
If you're installing it to a Windows computer create a folder somewhere and extract the files into it. For this example, we'll assume you are creating a folder called bw on your C drive. i.e. C:\bw  Once the files are extracted into the folder, navigate to the "home" folder (in this example C:\bw\home\ and click on "index.html" to open it in your default browser (depending upon your Windows Explorer settings, you may not see the ".html" ... that's OK. The browser will need to support running java - for example Chrome and Firefox work well. Once the Home Page of the Buddha's Words opens, it might be a good idea to bookmark it so that you can come back to it without going through the previous steps.

3. Installing onto an Android Device.
It's probably easiest to get the files extracted and working on a PC as above and to then connect your Android device to the PC via USB and copy the whole folder to the main storage of the device. (In this way you maximise your chances of it working correctly although in many instances, copying the files to the SD card can also work).

However you want to do it, you will need to end up with the files in a folder somewhere on your Android device in exactly the same structure as they were extracted. We'll asssume in this example that the files are in the main storage of your Android device in a folder called "bw".

You probably won't be able to open the Home Page just by navigating to it with the file manager that came with your Android device. You will need to find out the file path and somehow get that path into your browser (ideally Chrome or Firefox).

A trick is to use the free Astro File Manager to navigate to where you've copied The Buddha's Words. For example, if you've copied the files to your main storage into a folder called "bw" you'd navigate to "bw\home\index.html" and long press it to open it in your default browser. Once it's open, create a shortcut to it so you don't have to repeat the process. Optionally you may want to uninstall Astro File Manager.

Alternatively, using the file manager that came with your Android, navigate to where you have copied "\home\index.htm" and note the file path. If you copied it to your main storage into a folder called "bw" the path may be "file:///storage/emulated/0/bw/home/index.html" however there is a lot of inconsistency between android device manufacturers. :-/

4. Installing onto a Mac OSX Device.

Download the .zip file from Google Drive (https://tinyurl.com/y4gzyhgt) By default it will go to your Downloads folder. If the file hasn't 'unzipped' by itself, double-click the .zip file and you will get a folder containing The Buddha's Words.

Move the folder to somewhere more useful, maybe Documents or Desktop. (Optionally) rename the folder "BuddhasWords" or something meaningful to you.

Open the folder and scroll down to the home folder and open it.

Double click on index.html. The Buddha's Words will open in Safari or your default browser.

You may like to bookmark it to make it easier to find later (Command+D)
