<h3>Origin story </h3>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. At that time the monks of Āḷavī were building huts by means of begging. The huts were intended for themselves, did not have a sponsoring owner, and were inappropriately large. And since they were never finished, the monks kept on begging and asking, “Please give a man, a servant, an ox, a cart, a machete, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, a chisel; give creepers, bamboo, reeds, grass, clay.” People felt oppressed by all the begging and asking, so much so that when they saw a monk they became alarmed and fearful. They turned away, took a different path, ran off, and closed their doors. They even ran away when they saw cows, thinking they were monks. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>Just then Venerable Mahākassapa, after completing the rainy-season residence at Rājagaha, set out for Āḷavī. When he eventually arrived, he stayed at the Aggāḷava Shrine. One morning Venerable Mahākassapa robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Āḷavī for alms. When people saw him, they became alarmed and fearful. They turned away, took a different path, ran off, and closed their doors. When he had eaten his meal and returned from alms round, Venerable Mahākassapa returned and said to the monks: </p>

<p>“There used to be plenty of almsfood in Āḷavī, and it was easy to get by on alms. But now there’s a shortage, and it’s hard to get by. Why is that?” The monks told Venerable Mahākassapa what had happened. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>Soon afterwards the Buddha too set out wandering toward Āḷavī after staying at Rājagaha for as long as he liked. When he eventually arrived, he too stayed at the Aggāḷava Shrine. </p>

<p>Venerable Mahākassapa then went to see the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and told him what had happened. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>The Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks of Āḷavī: “Is it true, monks, that this is happening?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you act like this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<h5>Jātaka </h5>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>“Once upon a time, monks, two sages who were brothers lived near the river Ganges. On one occasion the dragon king Maṇikaṇṭha emerged from the Ganges and went up to the younger sage. He encircled him with seven coils and spread his large hood over his head. Then, because of his fear of that dragon, the younger sage became thin, haggard, and pale, with veins protruding all over his body. The older sage saw him like this and asked him what was the matter. The younger sage told him. The elder sage said, ‘So, do you want that dragon to stay away?’ </p>

<hr>

<p>‘Yes.’ </p>

<p>‘Well then, did you see anything belonging to that dragon?’ </p>

<hr>

<p>‘I saw an ornamental gem on his neck.’ </p>

<p>‘In that case, ask the dragon for that gem.’ </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>Soon the dragon king again emerged from the Ganges and went up to the younger sage. And the sage said to him, ‘Sir, give me the gem. I want the gem.’ The dragon thought, ‘The monk is asking for the gem; he wants the gem,’ and he left in a hurry. </p>

<p><span class="parno">7</span>Once more the dragon king emerged from the Ganges and approached the younger sage. The sage saw him coming and said to him, ‘Sir, give me the gem. I want the gem.’ When the dragon heard him, he turned around right there. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>Yet again the dragon king emerged from the Ganges. The younger sage saw him emerging and said to him, ‘Sir, give me the gem. I want the gem.’ The dragon king then spoke these verses to the sage: </p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">9</span>
‘My food and drink are abundant and sublime, <br>
And they appear because of this gem. <br>
I won’t give it to you—you ask too much—<br>
Nor will I return to your hermitage. </p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">10</span>
Like a youth holding a sword polished on a rock, <br>
You frighten me, asking for this gem. <br>
I won’t give it to you—you ask too much—<br>
Nor will I return to your hermitage.’ </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">11</span>And the dragon king Maṇikaṇṭha thought, ‘The monk is asking for the gem; he wants the gem,’ and he left and never returned. </p>

<p>Because he did not get to see that beautiful dragon, the young sage became even thinner, more haggard and pale, his veins protruding even more. The older sage saw him like this and asked what was the matter. He replied, ‘It’s because I no longer get to see that beautiful dragon.’ The older sage then spoke to him in verse: </p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">12</span>
‘One shouldn’t beg from those one wishes to be dear to; <br>
One is detested for asking for too much. <br>
When the brahmin asked the dragon for his gem, <br>
It left and was never to be seen again.’ </p>

<p><span class="parno">13</span>One will be disliked even by animals, monks, for begging and asking, let alone by human beings.” </p>

<h5>Story </h5>

<p><span class="parno">14</span>“At one time, monks, a certain monk lived in a forest grove on the slopes of the Himalayas. Not far from that grove was a large, low-lying marsh. A great flock of birds fed in the marsh during the day and entered the grove to roost at night. The monk was disturbed by the noise of the flocking birds, and so he came to see me. He bowed, sat down, and I said to him, ‘I hope you’re keeping well, monk, I hope you’re getting by? I hope you’re not tired from traveling? And where have you come from?’ </p>

<p>‘I’m keeping well, Sir, I’m getting by. I’m not tired from traveling.’ He then explained where he had come from, adding, ‘That’s where I’ve come from, Sir. I left because I was disturbed by the noise of that flock of birds.’ </p>

<p>‘Do you want that flock of birds to stay away?’ </p>

<p>‘Yes, Sir.’ </p>

<p>‘Well then, go back to that forest grove. In the first part of the night, call out three times and say, “Listen to me, good birds. I want a feather from anyone roosting in this forest grove. Each one of you must give me a feather.” And in the middle and last part of the night do the same thing.’ </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">15</span>The monk returned to that forest grove and did as instructed. That flock of birds thought, ‘The monk is asking for a feather; he wants a feather,’ and they left that grove and never returned. One will be disliked even by animals, monks, for begging and asking, let alone by human beings. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">16</span>“The father of Raṭṭhapāla, monks, once spoke to his son with this verse: </p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">17</span>
‘All these people, Raṭṭhāpāla, <br>
Who come to me and beg—<br>
I don’t even know them. <br>
So why don’t <em>you</em> beg from me?’ </p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">18</span>
‘The beggar is disliked, <br>
And so is one who doesn’t give when asked. <br>
That’s why I do not beg from you; <br>
Please don’t hate me for this.’ </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">19</span>If the gentleman Raṭṭhapāla could say this to his own father, how much more can one person to another. </p>

<p><span class="parno">20</span>It’s hard, monks, for householders to acquire and protect their possessions. And still, foolish men, you kept on begging and asking for all sorts of things. This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">21</span>‘When a monk, by means of begging, builds a hut without a sponsoring owner and intended for himself, it is to be no more than twelve standard handspans long and seven wide inside. He must have monks approve a site where no harm will be done and which has space on all sides. If a monk, by means of begging, builds a hut on a site where harm will be done and which lacks space on all sides, or he does not have monks approve the site, or he exceeds the right size, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’” </p>

<h3>Definitions </h3>

<p><span class="parno">22</span><strong>By means of begging: </strong> having himself begged for a man, a servant, an ox, a cart, a machete, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, a chisel; creepers, bamboo, reed, grass, clay. </p>

<p><span class="parno">23</span><strong>A hut: </strong> plastered inside or plastered outside or plastered both inside and outside. </p>

<p><span class="parno">28</span><strong>And seven wide inside: </strong> measured inside. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">29</span><strong>He must have monks approve a site: </strong> The monk who wants to build a hut should clear a site. He should then approach the Sangha, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: </p>

<p>“Venerables, I want to build a hut by means of begging, without a sponsoring owner and intended for myself. I request the Sangha to inspect the site for that hut.” </p>

<p>He should make his request a second and a third time. If the whole Sangha is able to inspect the site, they should all go. If the whole Sangha is not able to inspect the site, then those monks there who are competent and capable—who know where harm will be done and where no harm will be done, who know what is meant by space on all sides and a lack of space on all sides—should be asked and then appointed. </p>

<p>“And, monks, they should be appointed like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">31</span>Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. Monk so-and-so wants to build a hut by means of begging, without a sponsoring owner and intended for himself.

<p><span class="parno">32</span>The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site for the hut of monk so-and-so. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’ </p>

<p><span class="parno">33</span>The appointed monks should go and inspect the site for the hut to find out if any harm will be done and if it has space on all sides. If harm will be done or it lacks space on all sides, they should say, ‘Don’t build here.’ If no harm will be done and it has space on all sides, they should inform the Sangha: ‘No harm will be done and it has space on all sides.’ The monk who wants to build the hut should then approach the Sangha, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: </p>

<p>‘Venerables, I wish to build a hut by means of begging, without a sponsoring owner and intended for myself. I request the Sangha to approve the site for the hut.’ </p>

<p>He should make his request a second and a third time. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: </p>
