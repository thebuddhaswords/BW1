<h3>Origin story </h3>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, the monks from the group of six were arguing with and speaking abusively to the good monks. They reviled and insulted them about their caste, name, family, occupation, profession, illnesses, physical traits, defilements, and offenses, and by calling them names. The monks of few desires complained and criticized them:</p>

<p>“How can the monks from the group of six argue with and abuse good monks? How can they revile and insult them about these things?” </p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: </p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that you’re doing this?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">2-3</span>The Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? 


This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>“Once upon a time, monks, there was a brahmin in Takkasilā who had an ox called Nandivisāla. On one occasion the ox said to that brahmin, ‘Go, brahmin, and bet a thousand coins with the wealthy merchant that your ox will pull one hundred carts tied together.’ </p>

<p>And that brahmin did just that. Then, after tying one hundred carts together and yoking Nandivisāla to them, he said, ‘Go, you fraud! Pull, you liar!’ But Nandivisāla didn’t budge. </p>

<p>Then that brahmin became depressed because he had lost a thousand coins. Nandivisāla said to him, ‘Why are you depressed?’ </p>

<p>‘Because I lost one thousand coins because of you.’ </p>

<hr>

<p>‘But why did you disgrace me by calling me a fraud when I’m not? Now go, brahmin, and make the same bet with that merchant, but increase the stakes to two thousand coins. Just don’t disgrace me by calling me a fraud.’ Once again that brahmin did just that. Then, after tying one hundred carts together and yoking Nandivisāla to them, he said, ‘Go, good ox! Pull, good ox!’ And Nandivisāla pulled those one hundred carts. </p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">5</span>‘One should say what’s pleasant,<br>
Never what’s unpleasant. <br>
Because of his pleasant speech, <br>
Heavy loads were pulled, <br>
And he obtained wealth; <br>
And he was delighted with that.’ </p>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>Even at that time, monks, reviling and insulting was unpleasant to me. How then could reviling and insulting be pleasant now? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>
