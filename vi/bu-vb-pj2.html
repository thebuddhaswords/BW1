<h3>Origin story</h3>
<h4>First sub-story</h4>
</div>
<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on the Vulture Peak. At that time a number of monks who were friends had made grass huts on the slope of Mount Isigili and had entered the rainy-season residence there. Among them was Venerable Dhaniya the potter. When the three months were over and they had completed the rainy-season residence, the monks demolished their grass huts, put away the grass and sticks, and left to wander the country. But Venerable Dhaniya spent the winter and the summer right  there. </p>

<p>Then, on one occasion, while Dhaniya was in the village to collect almsfood, some women gathering grass and firewood demolished his grass hut and took away the grass and sticks. A second time Dhaniya collected grass and sticks and made a grass hut, and again the hut was demolished in the same way. The same thing happened a third time. 
</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>Dhaniya thought, “Three times this has happened. But I’m well-trained and experienced in my own craft of pottery. Why don’t I knead mud myself and make a hut entirely of clay?” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>And he did just that. He then collected grass, sticks, and cow-dung, and he baked his hut. It was a pretty and attractive little hut, red in color like a scarlet rain-mite. And when struck, it sounded just like a bell. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>Soon afterwards the Buddha was descending from the Vulture Peak with a number of monks when he saw that hut. He said to the monks: </p>

<p>“What’s this pretty and attractive thing that’s red in color like a scarlet rain-mite?” </p>

<hr>

<p>The monks told the Buddha, who then rebuked Dhaniya: </p>

<p>“It’s not suitable for that foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could he make a hut entirely of clay? Doesn’t he have any consideration, compassion, and mercy for living beings? Go, monks, and demolish this hut, so that future generations don’t follow his example. </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">And, monks, you shouldn’t make a hut entirely of clay. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<p>Saying, “Yes, Sir,” they went to demolish it. </p>

<p>And Dhaniya said to them: “Why are you demolishing my hut?” </p>

<p>“The Buddha has asked us to.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Demolish it then, if the Lord of the Truth has said so.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>Dhaniya thought, “Three times, while I was in the village to collect almsfood, women gathering grass and firewood demolished my hut and took away the grass and sticks. And now my hut made entirely of clay has been demolished at the Buddha’s request. Now, the caretaker of the woodyard is a friend of mine. Why don’t I ask him for timber and make a hut out of that?” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>Dhaniya then went to the caretaker of the woodyard and told him what had happened, adding, “Please give me some timber, I want to make a wooden hut.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“There’s no timber, Sir, that I could give you. This timber is held by the King. It’s meant for repairs of the town and put aside in case of an emergency. You can only have it if the King gives it away.” </p>

<p>“Actually, it’s been given by the King.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">7</span>The caretaker of the woodyard thought, “These Sakyan monastics have integrity. They are celibate and their conduct is good, and they are truthful, moral, and have a good character. Even the King has faith in them. These venerables wouldn’t say something is given if it wasn’t.” And he said to Dhaniya, “You may take it, Sir.” Dhaniya then had that timber cut into pieces, took it away on carts, and made a wooden hut. </p>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>Soon afterwards the brahmin Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, was inspecting the public works in Rājagaha when he went to the caretaker of the woodyard and said, “What’s going on? Where’s the timber held by the King that’s meant for repairs of the town and put aside in case of an emergency?” </p>

<p>“The King has given it to Venerable Dhaniya.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">9</span>Vassakāra was upset and thought, “How could the King give away this timber to Dhaniya the potter?” </p>

<p>He then went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and said, “Is it true, sir, that you have given away  to Dhaniya the potter the timber that was held for repairs of the town and put aside in case of an emergency?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Who said that?” </p>

<p>“The caretaker of the woodyard.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Well then, brahmin, summon the caretaker of the woodyard.” And Vassakāra had the caretaker of the woodyard bound and taken by force. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">10</span>Dhaniya saw this and said to him, “Why is this happening to you?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Because of the timber, Sir.” </p>

<p>“Go then, and I’ll come too.” </p>

<p>“Please come before I’m done for.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">11</span>Dhaniya then went to King Bimbisāra’s house and sat down on the prepared seat. The King approached Dhaniya, bowed, sat down, and said: </p>

<hr>

<p>“Is it true, Venerable, that I have given to you the timber held for repairs of the town and put aside in case of an emergency” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Yes, great king.” </p>

<p>“We kings are very busy—we may give and not remember. Please remind me.” </p>

<p>“Do you remember, great king, when you were first anointed, speaking these words: ‘I give the grass, sticks, and water for the monastics and brahmins to enjoy’?” </p>

<p>“I remember. There are monastics and brahmins who have a sense of conscience, who are afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. They are afraid of wrongdoing even in regard to small matters. When I spoke, I was referring to them, and it concerned what’s ownerless in the wilderness. Yet you imagine that you can take timber not given to you by means of this pretext? Even so, I cannot beat, imprison, or banish a monastic or brahmin living in my own kingdom. Go, you’re free because of your status, but don’t do such a thing again.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">12</span>But people complained and criticized him: “These Sakyan monastics are shameless and immoral liars. They claim to have integrity, to be celibate and of good conduct, to be truthful, moral, and good. But they don’t have the good character of a monastic or a brahmin. They’ve lost the plot! They even deceive the King, never mind other people.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">13</span>The monks heard the complaints of those people. The monks of few desires, who had a sense of conscience, and who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and fond of the training, complained and criticized Venerable Dhaniya, “How could he take the King’s timber without it being given to him?” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">14</span>After rebuking Dhaniya in many ways, they told the Buddha. The Buddha then had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned Venerable Dhaniya: </p>

<hr>

<p>“Is it true, Dhaniya, that you did this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<p>The Buddha rebuked him, “Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence and cause some to lose it.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">15</span>Just then a former judge who had gone forth with the monks was sitting near the Buddha. The Buddha said to him, “For stealing how much does King Bimbisāra beat, imprison, or banish a thief?” </p>

<p>“For stealing a <i lang="pi" translate="no">pāda</i> coin, Sir, or the value of a <i lang="pi" translate="no">pāda</i>.” At that time in Rājagaha a <i lang="pi" translate="no">pāda</i> coin was worth five <i lang="pi" translate="no">māsaka</i> coins. </p>

<hr>

<p>After rebuking Venerable Dhaniya in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">16</span>‘If a monk, intending to steal, takes what has not been given to him—the sort of stealing for which kings, having caught a thief, would beat, imprison, or banish him, saying, “You’re a bandit, you’re a fool, you’ve gone astray, you’re a thief”—he too is expelled and excluded from the community.’” </p>

<p><span class="parno">17</span>In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">18</span>At one time the monks from the group of six went to the dyers, stole their stock of cloth, brought it back to the monastery, and shared it out. The other monks said to them, “You have great merit, seeing that you’ve gotten so much robe-cloth.” </p>

<p>“How is it that we have merit? Just now we went to the dyers and stole their cloth.” </p>

<p>“But hasn’t the Buddha laid down a training rule? Why then do you steal the dyers’ cloth?” </p>

<p>“It’s true that the Buddha has laid down a training rule, but it concerns inhabited areas, not the wilderness.” </p>

<p>“But that’s just the same. It’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you steal the dyers’ cloth? This will affect people’s confidence, and cause some to lose it.” </p>

<p>After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">19</span>The Buddha had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned those monks: </p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that you did this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them, “It’s not suitable, foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence, and cause some to lose it.” Then, after rebuking the monks from the group of six in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … but he spoke in praise of … being energetic. Having given a teaching on what is right and proper, he addressed the monks … “And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">16</span>‘If a monk, intending to steal, takes from an inhabited area or from the wilderness what has not been given to him—the sort of stealing for which kings, having caught a thief, would beat, imprison, or banish him, saying, “You’re a bandit, you’re a fool, you’ve gone astray, you’re a thief”—he too is expelled and excluded from the community.’” </p>

<p><span class="parno">172</span>On one occasion a monk borrowed a piece of wood belonging to the Sangha and used it to support the wall of his own dwelling. The monks accused him, saying, “You’re not a monastic anymore!” He became anxious and told the Buddha. “What were you thinking, monk?” </p>

<p>“I was borrowing it, Sir.” </p><p>

“There’s no offense for one who is borrowing.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">173</span>On one occasion a monk took water from the Sangha, intending to steal it. … took clay from the Sangha, intending to steal it. … took a pile of grass from the Sangha, intending to steal it. … He became anxious … “You have committed an offense entailing expulsion.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">174</span>On one occasion a monk set fire to a pile of grass belonging to the Sangha, intending to steal. He became anxious … “There’s no offense entailing expulsion, but there’s an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">176</span>On one occasion a monk took a bench from the Sangha, intending to steal it … a mattress from the Sangha … a pillow from the Sangha … a door from the Sangha … a window from the Sangha … took a rafter from the Sangha, intending to steal it. … He became anxious … “You have committed an offense entailing expulsion.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">177</span>At one time the monks used elsewhere the furniture belonging to a certain lay follower. That lay follower complained and criticized them, “How can the Venerables use furniture where it doesn’t belong?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You shouldn’t use furniture where it doesn’t belong. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">178</span>Soon afterwards, being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not take any furniture to the observance-day hall or to meetings, and they sat down on the bare ground. They became dirty, as did their robes. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p>“I allow you to borrow.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">179</span>On one occasion at Campā, a nun who was a pupil of the nun Thullanandā went to a family that supported Thullanandā and said, “The Venerable wants to drink the triple pungent congee.” When it was ready, she took it away and ate it herself. When Thullanandā found out about this, she accused her, saying, “You’re not a monastic anymore!” She became anxious … She then told the nuns, who in turn told the monks, who then told the Buddha. “There’s no offense entailing expulsion, but there’s an offense entailing confession for lying in full awareness.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">180</span>On one occasion in Rājagaha, a nun who was a pupil of the nun Thullanandā went to a family that supported Thullanandā and said, “The Venerable wants a honey-ball.” When it was ready, she took it away and ate it herself. When Thullanandā found out about this, she accused her, saying, “You’re not a monastic anymore!” She became anxious … “There’s no offense entailing expulsion, but there’s an offense entailing confession for lying in full awareness.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">181</span>At that time there was  a householder in Vesāli who was a supporter of Venerable Ajjuka and who had two children living with him, a son and a nephew. He said to Ajjuka, “Sir, please assign my property to the one of these two boys who has faith and confidence.” </p>

<p>It turned out that the householder’s nephew had faith and confidence, and so Ajjuka assigned the property to him. He then established a household with that wealth and made a gift. </p>

<p>The householder’s son then said to Venerable Ānanda: </p>

<p>“Who is the father’s heir, Venerable Ānanda, the son or the nephew?” </p>

<p>“The son is the father’s heir.” </p>

<p>“Sir, Venerable Ajjuka has assigned our wealth to our housemate.” </p>

<p>“Venerable Ajjuka is not a monastic anymore.” </p>

<p>Ajjuka then said to Ānanda, “Ānanda, please do a proper investigation.” </p>

<p>On that occasion Venerable Upāli was siding with Ajjuka, and he said to Ānanda, “Ānanda, when one is asked by the owner to assign a property to so-and-so and one does as asked, what has one committed?” </p>

<p>“One hasn’t committed anything, Sir, not even an act of wrong conduct.” </p>

<p>“Venerable Ajjuka was asked by the owner to assign his property to so-and-so, which he did. There’s no offense for Venerable Ajjuka.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">182</span>At that time a family in Benares that supported Venerable Pilindavaccha was harassed by criminals. Two of their children were kidnapped. Soon afterwards Pilindavaccha brought those children back by his supernormal powers and put them in a stilt house. </p>

<p>When people saw those children, they said, “This is the greatness of Venerable Pilindavaccha’s supernormal powers,” and they gained confidence in him. </p>

<p>But the monks complained and criticized him, “How could Venerable Pilindavaccha bring back children who had been kidnapped by criminals?” They told the Buddha. </p><p>

“There’s no offense for someone who uses their supernormal powers.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">183</span>At that time the two monks Paṇḍaka and Kapila were friends. One was staying in a village and one at Kosambī. Then, while one of them was traveling from that village to Kosambī, he had to cross a river. As he did so, a lump of fat that had escaped from the hands of a pork-butcher stuck to his foot. He grabbed it, thinking, “I’ll give it to the owners.” But the owners accused him, saying, “You’re not a monastic anymore!” </p>

<p>Just then a woman cowherd who had seen him crossing said, “Come, Sir, have sexual intercourse.” Thinking he was no longer a monastic, he had sexual intercourse with her. When he arrived at Kosambī, he told the monks, who in turn told the Buddha. “There’s no offense entailing expulsion for stealing, but there’s an offense entailing expulsion for having sexual intercourse.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">184</span>At that time a monk at Sāgalā who was a student of Venerable Daḷhika was plagued by lust. He stole a turban from a shopkeeper and said to Daḷhika, “Sir, I’m not a monastic anymore. I’ll disrobe.” </p><p>

“But what have you done?” He told him. Venerable Daḷhika had the turban brought and valued. It was worth less than five <i lang="pi" translate="no">māsaka</i> coins. Saying, “There’s no offense entailing expulsion,” he gave a teaching. And that monk was delighted. </p>

<p class="endsutta">

<span class="parno">375</span>The second offense entailing expulsion is finished. </p>
