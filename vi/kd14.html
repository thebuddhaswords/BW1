<h4>1. Resolution face-to-face</h4>

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the monks from the group of six did legal procedures condemnation, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, and ejectionagainst monks who were absent. The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks from the group of six do this?”  They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha of monks gathered and questioned them:</p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are doing this?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.”</p>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them:</p>

<p>“It’s not suitable for those foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How can they do this?  This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:</p>

<h4>2. Resolution through recollection</h4>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>At one time when the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, Venerable Dabba the Mallian realized perfection at the age of seven. He had achieved all there is to achieve by a disciple and had nothing further to do. Then, while reflecting in private he thought: “How can I be of service to the Saṅgha?</p>

<hr>

<p>Why don’t I assign the dwellings and designate the meals?”</p>

<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>In the evening Dabba came out of seclusion and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down, and said: “Venerable Sir, while I was reflecting in private, it occurred to me that I’ve achieved all there is to achieve by a disciple, and I was wondering how I could be of service to the Saṅgha. I thought, ‘Why don’t I assign the dwellings and designate the meals?’” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Good, good, Dabba, please do so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Monks, the Saṅgha should appoint Dabba the Mallian as the assigner of dwellings and the designator of meals. And he should be appointed like this. First Dabba should be asked. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha:</p>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, it should appoint Venerable Dabba the Mallian as the assigner of dwellings and the designator of meals. This is the motion.</p>

<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The Saṅgha appoints Venerable Dabba the Mallian as the assigner of dwellings and the designator of meals. Any monk who approves of appointing Venerable Dabba as the assigner of dwellings and the designator of meals should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.</p>

<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>The Saṅgha has appointed Venerable Dabba the Mallian as the assigner of dwellings and the designator of meals. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’”</p>

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>Dabba assigned dwellings to the monks according to their character. He assigned dwellings in the same place to those monks who were experts on the discourse, thinking: “They’ll recite the discourses together.” And he did likewise for the experts on Monastic Law, thinking: “They’ll discuss the Monastic Law;” for the expounders of the Teaching, thinking: “They’ll discuss the Teaching;” for the meditators, thinking: “They won’t disturb one another;” and for the gossips and the bodybuilders, thinking: “In this way even these venerables will be happy.”</p>

<p>When monks arrived at night, he entered the fire element and assigned dwellings with the help of that light. Monks even arrived late on purpose, hoping to see the marvel of Dabba’s supernormal powers.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>They would approach Dabba and say: “Venerable Dabba, please assign us a dwelling.” </p>

<p>“Where would you like to stay?”</p>

<p>They would intentionally suggest somewhere far away: “On the Vulture Peak,” “At Robbers’ Cliff,” “On Black Rock on the slope of Mount Isigili,” “In the Sattapaṇṇi Cave on the slope of Mount Vebhāra,” “In Cool Grove on the hill at the Snake’s Pool,” “At Gotamaka Gorge,” “At Tinduka Gorge,” “At Tapoda Gorge,” “In Tapoda Park,” “In Jīvaka’s Mango Grove,” “In the deer park at Maddakucchi.”</p>

<p id="p30"><span class="parno">30</span>Dabba then entered the fire element, and with his finger glowing, he walked in front of those monks. They followed behind him with the help of that light. And he would assign them dwellings: “This is the bed, this the bench, this the mattress, this the pillow, this the place for defecating, this the place for urinating, this the water for drinking, this the water for washing, this the walking stick; these are the Saṅgha’s agreements concerning the right time to enter and the right time to leave.” Dabba then returned to the Bamboo Grove.</p>

<p id="p31"><span class="parno">31</span>At that time the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka were only newly ordained. They had little merit, getting inferior dwellings and meals. The people of Rājagaha were keen on giving specially prepared almsfood to the senior monks - ghee, oil, and special curries but to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka they gave ordinary food of porridge and broken rice.</p>

<p>After the meal, when they had returned from alms round, they asked the senior monks: “What did you get at the dining hall?”</p>

<p>Some said: “We got ghee, oil, and special curries.”</p>

<p>But the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said: “We didn’t get anything except ordinary food of porridge and broken rice.”</p>

<p>At that time there was a householder who gave a regular meal of fine food to four monks. He made his offering in the dining hall together with his wives and children. Some of them offered rice, some bean curry, some oil, and some special curries.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p32"><span class="parno">32</span>On one occasion the meal to be given by this householder on the following day had been designated to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka. Just then that householder went to the monastery on some business. He approached Dabba, bowed, and sat down. Dabba instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching. After the talk, he asked Dabba: “Sir, who's been designated to receive tomorrow’s meal in our house?”</p>

<hr>

<p>“Mettiya and Bhūmajaka.”</p>

<p>He was disappointed, and thought: “Why should bad monks eat in our house?” After returning to his house, he told a female slave: “For those who are coming for tomorrow’s meal, prepare seats at the gateway and serve them broken rice and porridge.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p33"><span class="parno">33</span>The monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said to each other: “Yesterday we were designated a meal from that householder who offers fine food. Tomorrow he’ll serve us together with his wives and children. Some of them will offer us rice, some bean curry, some oil, and some special curries.” And because they were excited, they did not sleep properly that night.</p>

<p>The following morning they robed up, took their bowls and robes, and went to the house of that householder. When the female slave saw them coming, she prepared seats at the gateway and said to them: “Please sit, Venerables.”</p>

<p>They thought: “The meal can’t be ready, since we’re given seats at the gateway.” She then brought them broken rice and porridge and said: “Eat, Sirs.”</p>

<p>“But, Sister, we’ve come for the regular meal.”</p>

<p>“I know. But yesterday I was told by the head of the household to serve you like this. Please eat.”</p>

<hr>

<p>They said to each other: “Yesterday this householder came to the monastery and spoke with Dabba. Dabba must be responsible for this split between the householder and us.” And because they were dejected, they did not eat as much as they had intended. </p>

<p>After the meal they returned to the monastery, put their bowls and robes away, and squatted on their heels outside the monastery gateway, using their upper robe as a back-and-knee strap. They were silent and humiliated, with shoulders drooping and heads down, glum and speechless.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p34"><span class="parno">34</span>Just then the nun Mettiyā came to them and said: “My respectful greetings to you, Venerables.” But they did not respond. A second time and a third time she said the same thing,  but they still did not respond.</p>

<p>“Have I done something wrong? Why don’t you respond?”</p>

<p>“It’s because we’ve been badly treated by Dabba the Mallian, and you’re not taking an interest.”</p>

<p>“But what can I do?”</p>

<p>“If you like, you could make the Buddha expel Dabba.”</p>

<p>

<p>“And how can I do that?”</p>

<p>“Go to the Buddha and say, ‘Venerable Sir, this isn’t proper or appropriate. There’s fear, distress, and oppression in this district, where none of these should exist. It’s windy where it should be calm. It’s as if water is burning. Venerable Dabba the Mallian has raped me.’”</p>

<hr>

<p>Saying: “Alright, Venerables,” she went to the Buddha, bowed, and repeated what she had been told to say.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p35"><span class="parno">35</span>Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned Dabba: </p>

<p>“Dabba, do you remember doing as the nun Mettiyā says?”</p>

<hr>

<p>“Venerable Sir, you know what I’m like.”</p>

<p>A second and a third time the Buddha asked the same question and got the same response. </p>

<hr>

<p>He then said: “Dabba, the Dabbas don’t give such evasive answers. If it was done by you, say so; if it wasn’t, then say that.”</p>

<p>“Since I was born, Sir, I don’t recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream, let alone when awake.”</p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha addressed the monks: “Well then, monks, expel the nun Mettiyā, and call these monks to account.” The Buddha then got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p36"><span class="parno">36</span>When the monks had expelled the nun Mettiyā, the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said to them: “Don’t expel the nun Mettiyā; she hasn’t done anything wrong. She was urged on by us. We were angry and displeased, and trying to make Dabba give up the monastic life.”</p>

<p>“But did you groundlessly charge Venerable Dabba with failure in morality?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<hr>

<p>The monks of few desires … complained and criticized them: “How could the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka groundlessly charge Venerable Dabba with failure in morality?”</p>

<hr>

<p>They then told the Buddha. … “Is it true, monks, that you did this?”</p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” …</p>

<p>After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:</p>

<hr>

<p id="p37"><span class="parno">37</span>“Well then, because of his great clarity of memory, grant resolution through recollection to Dabba the Mallian. And it should be granted like this.</p>

<p>Dabba should approach the Saṅgha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:</p>

<hr>

<p>‘Venerables, these monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging me with failure in morality. Because of my great clarity of memory, I ask the Saṅgha for resolution through recollection.</p>

<p>Venerables, these monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging me with failure in morality. Because of my great clarity of memory, for the second time I ask the Saṅgha for resolution through recollection. </p>

<hr>

<p>Venerables, these monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging me with failure in morality. Because of my great clarity of memory, for the third time I ask the Saṅgha for resolution through recollection.’</p>

<p>A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha:</p>

<h4>3. Resolution because of past insanity</h4>

<p id="p43"><span class="parno">43</span>At one time the monk Gagga was insane and suffering from psychosis. Because of this, he did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. The monks accused him of an offense saying: </p>

<p>“Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such an offense?” “I was insane and suffering from psychosis. Because of that, I did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. I don’t remember it. I did it because I was insane.”<br>

<br>But they kept on accusing him in the same way. The monks of few desires … complained and criticized them: “How can these monks keep on accusing Gagga  when he says he was insane?”</p>

<hr>

<p>They told the Buddha. … He said: “Is it true, monks, that these monks are doing this?”</p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” …</p>

<p>After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:</p>

<hr>

<p>“Well then, since he’s no longer insane, grant the monk Gagga resolution because of past insanity. </p>

<p>And it should be granted like this. The monk Gagga should approach the Saṅgha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:</p>

<p>‘Venerables, I’ve been insane and suffering from psychosis. Because of that, I did and said many things unworthy of a monastic. The monks accused me of an offense, saying:</p>

<p>And he should ask a second time, and a third time:</p>

The Saṅgha, several monks, or a single monk accuses him, saying, ‘Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such an offense?’ Although he remembers, he says he doesn’t. If the Saṅgha grants him resolution because of past insanity, then that granting is illegitimate.</p>

<p id="p51"><span class="parno">51</span>It may be that a monk has committed an offense.

<h4>4. Acting according to what has been admitted</h4>

<p id="p57"><span class="parno">57</span>At one time the monks from the group of six did legal procedures - condemnation, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, and ejection against other monks without their admission. The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks from the group of six do this?”  They told the Buddha. …</p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are doing this?” “It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:</p>

<hr>

<p class='rule'>“You shouldn’t do legal procedures, condemnation, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, or ejection—against monks without their admission.If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.</p>

<p id="p59"><span class="parno">59</span>It may be that a monk has committed an offense entailing expulsion.

<p id="p60"><span class="parno">60</span>It may be that a monk has committed an offense entailing expulsion. The Saṅgha, several monks, or a single monk accuses him, saying, ‘Venerable, you've committed an offense entailing expulsion.’ He says, ‘I haven’t committed an offense entailing expulsion, but a serious offense … but an offense entailing confession … but an offense entailing acknowledgment … but an offense of wrong conduct … but an offense of wrong speech.’ If the Saṅgha makes him act according to an offense of wrong speech, then that acting according to what’s been admitted is illegitimate.</p>

<h4>5. Majority decision</h4>

<p id="p65"><span class="parno">65</span>At one time the monks were arguing and disputing in the midst of the Saṅgha, attacking one another verbally, and they were unable to resolve that legal issue. They told the Buddha.</p>

<p>“I allow you to resolve such legal issues by majority decision. You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the manager of the vote: one who isn’t swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and who knows who has and who hasn't voted. And he should be appointed like this. First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:</p>


<p id="p66"><span class="parno">66</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should appoint monk so-and-so as the manager of the vote. This is the motion.</p>

<p id="p69"><span class="parno">69</span>There are ten reasons why a vote is illegitimate:  it's only a minor legal issue; the full process for settling it hasn’t run its course; they haven’t tried to remember offenses and remind about offenses; the manager knows that those who speak contrary to the Teaching are in the majority; the manager expects that those who speak contrary to the Teaching will be in the majority; the manager knows that the Saṅgha will split; the manager expects that the Saṅgha will split; they vote illegitimately; they vote with an incomplete assembly; they don’t vote according to their own views. </p>

<p id="p70"><span class="parno">70</span>And there are ten reasons why a vote is legitimate: it’s not a minor legal issue; the full process for settling it has run its course; they've tried to remember offenses and remind about offenses; the manager knows that those who speak in accordance with the Teaching are in the majority; the manager expects that those who speak in accordance with the Teaching will be in the majority; the manager knows that the Saṅgha won't split; the manager expects that the Saṅgha won't split; they vote legitimately; they vote with a complete assembly; they vote according to their own views.” </p>

<h4>6. Further penalty</h4>

<p id="p71"><span class="parno">71</span>On one occasion, when the monk Upavāḷa was being examined in the midst of the Saṅgha about an offense, he asserted things after denying them, denied things after asserting them, evaded the issue, and lied. The monks of few desires complained and criticized him: “How can the monk Upavāḷa act like this?”</p>

<p>They told the Buddha. … “Is it true, monks, that the monk Upavāḷa is acting like this?”</p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” …</p>

<p>After rebuking him … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:</p>

<hr>

<p>“Well then, the Saṅgha should do a legal procedure of further penalty against the monk Upavāḷa. And it should be done like this. </p>

<p>First you should accuse the monk Upavāḷa. He should then be reminded of what he’s done, before he’s charged with an offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha:</p>

<p id="p72"><span class="parno">72</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen.

<p id="p103"><span class="parno">103</span>“Monks, there are four kinds of legal issues: legal issues arising from disputes; legal issues arising from accusations; legal issues arising from offenses; legal issues arising from business.</p>


<p id="p104"><span class="parno">104</span>(1a) What’s a legal issue arising from a dispute? It may be that the monks are disputing, saying, ‘This is the Teaching’, ‘This is contrary to the Teaching’, ‘This is the Monastic Law’, ‘This is contrary to the Monastic Law’, ‘This was spoken by the Buddha’, ‘This wasn’t spoken by the Buddha’, ‘This was practiced by the Buddha’, ‘This wasn’t practiced by the Buddha’, ‘This was laid down by the Buddha’, ‘This wasn’t laid down by the Buddha’, ‘This is an offense’, ‘This isn’t an offense’, ‘This is a light offense’, ‘This is a heavy offense’, ‘This is a curable offense’, ‘This is an incurable offense’, ‘This is a grave offense’, or ‘This is a minor offense.’ In regard to this, whatever there is of quarreling, arguing, conflict, disputing, variety in opinion, difference in opinion, heated speech, or strife—
this is called a legal issue arising from a dispute.</p>


<p id="p105"><span class="parno">105</span>(1b) What’s a legal issue arising from an accusation?

In regard to this, whatever there is of accusations, accusing, allegations, blame, taking sides because of friendship, taking part in the accusation, or supporting the accusation—

Disputes are unbeneficial and a cause of unhappiness for humanity; they’re harmful, detrimental, and a cause of suffering for gods and humans. Monks, when you see such a root of disputes either in yourself or others, you should make an effort to get rid of it. If you don’t see such a root either in yourself or others, you should practice so that it doesn’t emerge in the future. In this way that bad root of disputes is abandoned and doesn’t emerge in the future.</p>

<p id="p109"><span class="parno">109</span>Or it may be that a monk is denigrating and controlling, envious and stingy, treacherous and deceitful, one who has bad desires and wrong views, or one who obstinately grasps his own views and only gives them up with difficulty.

 <p>One who’s virtuous and restrained by the Monastic Code. His conduct is good, he associates with the right people, and he sees danger in minor faults. He undertakes and trains in the training rules.</p>
<p>One who has learned much, and who retains and accumulates what he’s learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, that have a true goal and are well articulated, and that set out the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life—he’s learned many such teachings, retained them in mind, recited them verbally, mentally investigated them, and penetrated them well by view.</p>
<p>One who has properly learned both Monastic Codes in detail; who has analyzed them well, thoroughly mastered them, and investigated them well, both in terms of the rules and their detailed exposition.</p>
<p>One who is firmly committed to the Monastic Law.</p>
<p>One who is capable of making both sides relax, of persuading them, of convincing them, of making them see, of reconciling them.</p>
<p>One who is knowledgeable about the arising and resolution of legal issues.</p>
<p>One who understands legal issues.</p>
<p>One who understands the arising of legal issues.</p>

<h4>9.4 The three kinds of voting</h4>

<p id="p176"><span class="parno">176</span>At one time at Sāvatthī a legal issue had come about in this way. But those monks were dissatisfied with how the Saṅgha at Sāvatthī had resolved it. They heard that in a certain monastery there was a number of senior monks who were learned and masters of the tradition; who were experts on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Key Terms; who were knowledgeable and competent, had a sense of conscience, and were afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. They thought: “If these senior monks resolve this legal issue—according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—then it will be properly disposed of.” They then went to that monastery and said to those senior monks: “This legal issue has come about like this. It would be good, Venerables, if you would resolve it—according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—so that it’ll be properly disposed of.” Those senior monks thought: “This legal issue was properly disposed of by the Saṅgha at Sāvatthī,” and they resolved it in the same way.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p177"><span class="parno">177</span>Those monks were dissatisfied with how the Saṅgha at Sāvatthī had resolved that legal issue and also with how that number of senior monks had resolved it. They then heard that in a certain monastery there were three senior monks … two senior monks … one senior monk who was learned and a master of the tradition; who was an expert on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Key Terms; who was knowledgeable and competent, had a sense of conscience, and was afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. They thought: “If this senior monk resolves this legal issue—according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—then it will be properly disposed of.” They then went to that monastery and said to that senior monk: “This legal issue has come about in this way. It would be good, Venerable, if you would resolve it—according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—so that it will be properly disposed of.” That senior monk thought: “This legal issue was properly disposed of by the Saṅgha at Sāvatthī, and likewise by that number of senior monks, by those three senior monks, and by those two senior monks,” and he disposed of it in the same way.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p178"><span class="parno">178</span>Since those monks were dissatisfied with how all of these had disposed of that legal issue, they went to the Buddha and told him what had happened. …</p>

<hr>

<p id="p179"><span class="parno">179</span>The Buddha said: “Monks, this legal issue has been settled, laid to rest, and properly disposed of. To persuade those monks, I allow three kinds of voting: a secret ballot, whispering in the ear, and an open vote.</p>

<p id="p180"><span class="parno">180</span>What’s a secret ballot? The manager of the vote should make ballots of two different colors, go up to the monks one by one and say, ‘This is the ballot for those who hold this view, and this is the ballot for those who hold that view. Take the one you like.’ When anyone has taken a ballot, they should be told, ‘Don’t show it to anyone.’ If the manager knows that those who speak contrary to the Teaching are in the majority, then the vote is invalid and to be postponed. If he knows that those who speak in accordance with the Teaching are in the majority, then the vote is valid and to be announced. </p>

<p id="p181"><span class="parno">181</span>What’s voting by whispering in the ear? The manager of the vote should inform the monks one by one by whispering in the ear, ‘This is the ballot for those who hold this view, and this is the ballot for those who hold that view. Take the one you like.’ When someone has taken a ballot, they should be told, ‘Don’t tell anyone.’ If the manager knows that those who speak contrary to the Teaching are in the majority, then the vote is invalid and to be postponed. If he knows that those who speak in accordance with the Teaching are in the majority, then the vote is valid and to be announced. </p>

<p id="p182"><span class="parno">182</span>What’s an open vote? If he knows that those who speak in accordance with the Teaching are in the majority, the ballots should be distributed openly.” </p>

<h4>9.5 Resolution through recollection</h4>

So when asked about a heavy offense, why wouldn’t I admit it?’ The accusing monk says, ‘But you didn’t admit that you had committed this minor offense without being asked. So when asked about a heavy offense, why would you admit it? Come on, Venerable, try harder to  remember whether you’ve committed such-and-such a heavy offense.’ He then says, ‘I remember committing such-and-such a heavy offense entailing expulsion or bordering on expulsion.

<p id="p202"><span class="parno">202</span>This is called the resolution of a legal issue.  It’s been resolved face-to-face and by further penalty. Face-to-face with what? Face-to-face with the Saṅgha, the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the persons concerned.

This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Teaching and the Monastic Law: the Teaching, the Monastic Law, the Teacher’s instruction—that by which that legal issue is resolved. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the persons concerned: both those who are accusing and those who have been accused are present. This is the meaning of ‘by further penalty’: the doing of, the performing of, the participation in, the consent to, the agreement to, the non-objection to that legal procedure of further penalty.  When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if any of the participants reopen it, they incur an offense entailing confession for the reopening.

<h4>9.8 Acting according to what has been admitted</h4>

<p id="p203"><span class="parno">203</span>“There are three principles for settling a legal issue arising from an offense: resolution face-to-face, acting according to what’s been admitted, and covering over as if with grass. Is it possible that a legal issue arising from an accusation should be settled not by covering over as if with grass, but by resolution face-to-face and by acting according to what’s been admitted? It is. How? It may be that a monk has committed a light offense. That monk should approach a single monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:</p>

<p>‘I’ve committed such-and-such an offense. I confess it.’ —
‘Do you recognize that offense?’ —
‘Yes, I recognize it.’ —
‘You should restrain yourself in the future.’</p>
