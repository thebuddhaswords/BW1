<h3>Translator's Introduction</h3>

<div id="intro">

<p>The Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha contains 311 rules. Of these, 181 are shared with the Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha: four Pārājikas, seven Saṅghādisesas, 18 Nissaggiya Pācittiyas (NP), 70 Pācittiyas, all 75 Sekhiyas, and all seven Adhikaraṇa-samatha rules. In addition, the Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha contains 13 Pācittiya rules that are identical to rules for bhikkhus that are contained in the Khandhakas; one Pārājika rule similar to a Bhikkhus' Saṅghādisesa rule; one Pārājika rule similar to a Bhikkhus' Pācittiya rule; two Saṅghādisesa rules similar to Bhikkhus' Khandhaka rules; two NP rules similar to Bhikkhus' NP rules; three Pācittiyas similar to a Bhikkhus' Saṅghādisesa; seven Pācittiyas similar to Bhikkhus' Pācittiyas; and eight Pācittiyas similar to rules for bhikkhus that are contained in the Khandhakas. Also, the eight Pāṭidesanīya rules for the bhikkhunīs are elaborations of a single Bhikkhus' Pācittiya rule.</p>

<p>Thus the Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha contains 85 rules for which there are no direct correspondences in the rules for the bhikkhus. Some writers have interpreted these added rules as sign of an attempt to oppress the bhikkhunīs unfairly, but it should be noted that:</p>

<ol>
	<li>more than one third of these extra rules were formulated to protect bhikkhunīs from being the direct recipients of the abusive or careless behavior of other bhikkhunīs;</li>
	<li>two of the extra rules (Pācittiyas <a href="#pc-6">6</a> and <a href="#pc-44">44</a>) prevent bhikkhunīs from putting themselves in a position of servitude to bhikkhus or lay people;</li>
	<li>according to the rules' origin stories, all but three of the extra rules (Pācittiyas <a href="#pc-59">59</a>, <a href="#pc-94">94</a>, and <a href="#pc-95">95</a>) were formulated only after bhikkhunīs complained to the bhikkhus about an errant bhikkhunī's behavior.</li>
</ol>

<p>Tellingly, these last three exceptions were formulated after complaints initiated by the bhikkhus, and they touch directly on the formal subordination of the Bhikkhunī Community to the Bhikkhu Community. However, they are counterbalanced by two rules exclusive to the Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha — <a href="../vi/bu-pt.html#np-4">NP 4</a> &amp; <a href="../vi/bu-pt.html#np-17">17</a> — that were formulated at the request of bhikkhunīs to prevent bhikkhus from abusing their position in the hierarchy in a way that would interfere with the bhikkhunīs' practice of the Dhamma. For a more detailed discussion of the checks and balances in the relationships between the two Communities, see <a href="../bmc/bmc2.23.html"><i>The Buddhist Monastic Code,</i> volume II, chapter 23.</a></p>

<p>In the following translation, I have marked the correspondences between the bhikkhus' and bhikkhunīs' rules in brackets. Where the brackets follow the number of the bhikkhunī rule and simply contain a number, the corresponding bhikkhus' rule is in the same section in the Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha as in the Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha. Thus, under the Saṅghādisesa rules, 7 [5] means that the Bhikkhunīs' Saṅghādisesa 7 is identical with the Bhikkhus' Saṅghādisesa 5. If the brackets follow the rule and simply contain a reference to a rule in the Mahavagga (Mv) or Cullavagga (Cv), the corresponding bhikkhus' rule is contained in the Khandhakas. If the brackets follow the rule and include the word "see" followed by a number, the corresponding bhikkhus' rule is similar rather than identical. Correspondences in the Sekhiya and Adhikaraṇa-samatha sections are not marked, as these two sections are completely identical in the two Pāṭimokkhas.</p>

<p>Rules marked with an asterisk (*) are identical with — or directly related to — vows included in the Eight Garudhammas, or Rules of Respect. On this topic, see <a href="../bmc/bmc2.23.html#garudhammas"><i>The Buddhist Monastic Code,</i> volume 2, chapter 23</a>. Some writers have argued that, because the rules in question are all pācittiya rules, and because the Rules of Respect impose a more stringent penalty than a simple confession for overstepping the vows, we must assume that the vows and their more stringent punishment were added later to the canon, in an attempt to oppress the bhikkhunīs. However, a standard principle throughout the Vinaya — formulated in Adhikaraṇa-samatha 4 in both Pāṭimokkhas — is that an offender cannot be penalized until he/she has confessed to an offense. In light of this principle, the confession required by the pācittiya rules would be a first, necessary step before imposing the half-month penance stipulated in the fifth vow.</p>

<p>The translation here is based on the complete Pali Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha in Mohan Wijayaratna, <i>Buddhist Nuns: The Birth and Development of a Women's Monastic Order</i> (BN), although there were many spots where I had to rely on the Thai edition of the Pali Canon to correct mistakes in BN. I have also consulted I.B. Horner's partial English translation of the Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha rules in <i>The Book of Discipline,</i> volume three (BD); the partial Thai translation included in Mahamakut's complete translation of the Pali Canon; the complete English translation in BN; and the complete translation in <i>The Pāṭimokkha,</i> edited by William Pruitt and translated by K. R. Norman (N). Where my translation differs from BD, I have marked it with a (§); where it differs from BN, a (¶); where it differs from N, a (•).</p>

<p>Parenthetical insertions in the rules, if otherwise unmarked, are based on the canonical word-commentary from the Bhikkhunī Vibhaṅga, the part of the Vinaya Piṭaka that contains the Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha together with its explanatory material. If marked with the abbreviation "Comm:", parenthetical insertions in the rules are drawn from the Commentary, Buddhaghosa's Samantapasadika. Technical issues are explained in the endnotes.</p>

<h3><span class="add"><a id="prelim">Preliminaries</a></span></h3>

<p class="namo">Homage to the Blessed, Noble, and Perfectly Enlightened One</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>Sweeping, a lamp, water, together with seats.
<br>These are called the things to be done beforehand for the uposatha.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p>Consent, purity, announcing the season, counting bhikkhunis, the Ovada.
<br>These are called the preliminary duties for the uposatha.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p>Uposatha; all the bhikkhunis have arrived for the formal proceeding;
<br>none have shared offences;
<br>and there are no individuals to be avoided.
<br>This is called the appropriate time.</p>
</div>

<p>[Elder Bhikkhunī] Having completed what should be done beforehand and the preliminary duties, with the assent of the Bhikkhunī Saṅgha, one and all, with offences confessed, I invite the recitation of the patimokkha.</p>

<h3><span class="add"><a>The Recitation of the Introduction</a></span></h3>

<p>Venerable, let the Saṅgha hear me. Today is the uposatha of the fifteenth day. If the proper time has come for the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should carry out the patimokkha.</p>

<p>What is the preliminary duty for the Saṅgha? Venerables, you should announce your purity. I shall recite the patimokkha. Let all of us being [present] listen and attend carefully.</p>

<p>Whoever has an offence should reveal it. There being no offence, silence should be kept. I shall know by their silence that the venerables are pure. Just as one questioned individually would have an answer; in the same way, when (the patimokkha) is proclaimed up to the third time in such an assembly as this, should any bhikkhuni not reveal an offence that she remembers, this is a conscious lie for her. Venerables, a conscious lie has been pronounced by the Blessed One to be an obstructing matter. Therefore any offence which exists is to be revealed by a bhikkhuni, who having committed an offence, remembers it and looks for purification. When revealed, it is good for her.</p>

<p>Recited, venerables is the introduction. Herein I ask the venerables: Are you pure in this? A second time I ask: Are you pure in this? A third time I ask: Are you pure in this? The venerables are pure in this; therefore they are silent. So I remember it.</p>

<p class="endsection">The introduction is finished.</p>

<h3>Pārājika <a id="pr" class="back" href="#pr" title="Go up"></a></h3>

<p>Herein these eight matters entailing defeat come up for recitation.</p>

<p><b><a id="pr-1"></a>1 [<a href="../vi/bu-pt.html#pr-1">1</a>].</b> Should any bhikkhunī willingly engage in sexual intercourse, even with a male animal, she is defeated and no longer in affiliation.</p>

<p><b><a id="pr-2"></a>2 [<a href="../vi/bu-pt.html#pr-2">2</a>].</b> Should any bhikkhunī, in what is reckoned a theft, take what is not given from an inhabited area or from the wilderness — just as when, in the taking of what is not given, kings arresting the criminal would flog, imprison, or banish her, saying, "You are a robber, you are a fool, you are benighted, you are a thief" — a bhikkhunī in the same way taking what is not given is defeated and no longer in affiliation.</p>

<p><b><a id="pr-3"></a>3 [<a href="../vi/bu-pt.html#pr-3">3</a>].</b> Should any bhikkhunī intentionally deprive a human being of life, or search for an assassin for him, or praise the advantages of death, or incite him to die, saying, "My good man, what use is this evil, miserable life to you? Death would be better for you than life," or with such an idea in mind, such a purpose in mind, should in various ways praise the advantages of death or incite him to die, she also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.</p>

<p><b><a id="pr-4"></a>4 [<a href="../vi/bu-pt.html#pr-4">4</a>].</b> Should any bhikkhunī, without direct knowledge, boast of a superior human state, a truly noble knowledge and vision as present in herself, saying, "Thus do I know; thus do I see," such that regardless of whether or not she is cross-examined on a later occasion, she — being remorseful and desirous of purification — might say, "Ladies, not knowing, I said I know; not seeing, I said I see — vainly, falsely, idly," unless it was from over-estimation, she also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.</p>

<p><a id="pr-5"></a>5. Should any bhikkhunī, lusting, consent to a lusting man's rubbing, rubbing up against, taking hold of, touching, or fondling (her) below the collar-bone and above the circle of the knees, she also is defeated and no longer in affiliation for being "one above the circle of the knees." [See <a href="../vi/bu-pt.html#sg-2">Bhikkhus' Saṅghādisesa 2</a>]</p>

<p><a id="pr-6"></a>6. Should any bhikkhunī, knowing that (another) bhikkhunī has fallen into an act (entailing) defeat, neither accuse her herself nor inform the group, and then — whether she (the other bhikkhunī) is still alive or has died, has been expelled or gone over to another sect — she (this bhikkhunī) should say, "Even before, ladies, I knew of this bhikkhunī that 'This sister is of such-and-such a sort,' and I didn't accuse her myself nor did I inform the group," then she also is defeated and no longer in affiliation for being "one who concealed a fault." [See <a href="../vi/bu-pt.html#pc-64">Bhikkhus' Pācittiya&nbsp;64</a>]</p>

<p><a id="pr-7"></a>7. Should any bhikkhunī follow a bhikkhu who has been suspended by a united Community (of bhikkhus) in line with the Dhamma, in line with the Vinaya, in line with the teacher's instructions, and who is disrespectful, has not made amends, has broken off his friendship (with the bhikkhus), the bhikkhunīs are to admonish her thus: "Lady, that bhikkhu has been suspended by a united Community in line with the Dhamma, in line with the Vinaya, in line with the teacher's instructions. He is disrespectful, he has not made amends, he has broken off his friendship. Do not follow him, lady."</p>

<p><span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The syntax of this rule allows for two interpretations of the phrase, "with the Dhamma, with the Vinaya, with the teacher's instructions." BD, BN, and N all take it as connected with the phrase, "disrespectful, has not made amends, has broken off his friendship" thus: "he is disrespectful, has not made amends, has broken off his friendship with the Dhamma, with the Vinaya, with the teacher's instructions." I, however, follow the Commentary in connecting it with the term "suspended." An argument for ignoring the Commentary here might be that its interpretation does not follow normal sentence order. An argument for following it would be that (1) the formal legal language of training rules sometimes deviates from normal sentence order and (2) the word "disrespectful," for one, takes the locative case for its object, not the instrumental, which is used here. With regard to point (1), the word order in the relevant sentence might be explained by the fact that there was a need to separate "Community," also in the instrumental, from the instrumentals in the phrase "in line with the Dhamma," etc.</span></span></span>And should that bhikkhunī, thus admonished by the bhikkhunīs, persist as before, the bhikkhunīs are to rebuke her up to three times so as to desist. If while being rebuked up to three times she desists, that is good. If she does not desist, then she also is defeated and no longer in affiliation for being "a follower of a suspended (bhikkhu)." <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">There is also a good practical reason to follow the Commentary here, in that if the Community of bhikkhus acting in unity suspended the bhikkhu in question in a transaction that was not in line with the Dhamma, the Vinaya, the teacher's instructions, then there is no good reason that the bhikkhunī following him should be subject to this rule.</span></span></span>(§¶•)</p>

<p><a id="pr-8"></a>8. Should any bhikkhunī, lusting, consent to a lusting man's taking hold of her hand or touching the edge of her outer robe, or should she stand with him or converse with him or go to a rendezvous with him, or should she consent to his approaching her, or should she enter a hidden place with him, or should she dispose her body to him — (any of these) for the purpose of that unrighteous act (Comm: physical contact) — then she also is defeated and no longer in affiliation for "(any of) eight grounds." (§)</p>

<p>Recited, venerables, are the eight matters entailing defeat. If a bhikkhuni has commited one or other of these offences, she is no longer allowed to [live in] communion with bhikkhunis; as [she was] before [ordination] so [she is] after [the confession of the offence]; she becomes defeated, not in communion. Herein I ask the venerables: Are you pure in this? A second time I ask: Are you pure in this? A third time I ask: Are you pure in this? The venerables are pure in this; therefore they are silent. So I remember it.</p>

<p><b><a id="sg-1"></a>1.</b> Should any bhikkhunī start litigation against a householder, a householder's son, a slave, or a worker, or even against a wandering contemplative: this bhikkhunī, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.

<p><b><a id="sg-2"></a>2.</b> Should any bhikkhunī knowingly give Acceptance <i>(upasampada)</i> to a woman thief sentenced to death, without having obtained permission from the king or the Community or the (governing) council or the (governing) committee or the (governing) guild — unless the woman is allowable (i.e., already ordained in another sect or with other bhikkhunīs) — this bhikkhunī, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community. <span class="add translator"><a href="../vi/kd1.html#431">See Khandhaka&nbsp;1 (Mv 1)</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="sg-4"></a>4.</b> Should any bhikkhunī — without having obtained permission from the Community who performed the act, without knowing the desire of the group — restore a bhikkhunī whom a Community acting harmony in line with the Dhamma, in line with the Vinaya, in line with the teacher's instructions, has suspended: this bhikkhunī, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community. <span class="add translator"><a href="../vi/kd11.html#">See Khandhaka&nbsp;11 (Cv&nbsp;1)</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="sg-10"></a>10.</b> Should any bhikkhunī, angry and displeased, say, "I repudiate the Buddha, I repudiate the Dhamma, I repudiate the Saṅgha, I repudiate the Training.

<p><b><a id="sg-13"></a>13.</b> Should any bhikkhunī say (to the bhikkhunīs criticized in the preceding case), "Live entangled, ladies. Don't live separately. There are other bhikkhunīs in the Community with the same conduct, the same reputation, the same notoriety, exasperating the Bhikkhunī Community, hiding one another's faults, but the Community doesn't say anything to them.

<p><b><a id="sg-14"></a>14 [<a href="../vi/bu-pt.html#sg-10">10</a>].</b> Should any bhikkhunī agitate for a schism in a united Community, or should she persist in taking up an issue conducive to schism, the bhikkhunīs are to admonish her thus: "Do not, lady, agitate for a schism in a united Community or persist in taking up an issue conducive to schism. Let the lady be reconciled with the Community, for a united Community, on courteous terms, without dispute, with a common recitation, dwells in peace."</p>

<p><b><a id="sg-15"></a>15 [<a href="../vi/bu-pt.html#sg-11">11</a>].</b> Should bhikkhunīs — one, two, or three — who are followers and partisans of that bhikkhunī, say, "Do not, ladies, admonish that bhikkhunī in any way. She is an exponent of the Dhamma, she is an exponent of the Vinaya. She acts with our consent and approval. She knows, she speaks for us, and that is pleasing to us," the bhikkhunīs are to admonish them thus: "Do not say that, ladies. That bhikkhunī is not an exponent of the Dhamma and she is not an exponent of the Vinaya. Do not, ladies, approve of a schism in the Community. Let the ladies' (minds) be reconciled with the Community, for a united Community, on courteous terms, without dispute, with a common recitation, dwells in peace."</p>

<p><b><a id="sg-16"></a>16 [<a href="../vi/bu-pt.html#sg-12">12</a>].</b> In case a bhikkhunī is by nature difficult to admonish — who, when being legitimately admonished by the bhikkhunīs with reference to the training rules included in the (Pāṭimokkha) recitation, makes herself unadmonishable, (saying,) "Do not, ladies, say anything to me, good or bad; and I won't say anything to the ladies, good or bad. Refrain, ladies, from admonishing me" — the bhikkhunīs are to admonish her thus: "Let the lady not make herself unadmonishable. Let the lady make herself admonishable. Let the lady admonish the bhikkhunīs in accordance with what is right, and the bhikkhunīs will admonish the lady in accordance with what is right; for it is thus that the Blessed One's following is nurtured: through mutual admonition, through mutual rehabilitation."</p>

<p>And should that bhikkhunī, thus admonished by the bhikkhunīs, persist as before, the bhikkhunīs are to rebuke her up to three times so as to desist. If while being rebuked up to three times she desists, that is good. If she does not desist, then this bhikkhunī, also, as soon as she has fallen into the third act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

<p><b><a id="sg-17"></a>17 [<a href="../vi/bu-pt.html#sg-13">13</a>].</b> In case a bhikkhunī living in dependence on a certain village or town is a corrupter of families, a woman of depraved conduct — whose depraved conduct is both seen and heard about, and the families she has corrupted are both seen and heard about — the bhikkhunīs are to admonish her thus: "You, lady, are a corrupter of families, a woman of depraved conduct. Your depraved conduct is both seen and heard about, and the families you have corrupted are both seen and heard about. Leave this monastery, lady. Enough of your staying here."</p>

<p>And should that bhikkhunī, thus admonished by the bhikkhunīs, say about the bhikkhunīs, "The bhikkhunīs are biased through favoritism, biased through aversion, biased through delusion, biased through fear, in that for this sort of offense they banish some and do not banish others," the bhikkhunīs are to admonish her thus: "Do not say that, lady. The bhikkhunīs are not biased through favoritism, are not biased through aversion, are not biased through delusion, are not biased through fear. You, lady, are a corrupter of families, a woman of depraved conduct. Your depraved conduct is both seen and heard about, and the families you have corrupted are both seen and heard about. Leave this monastery, lady. Enough of your staying here."</p>

<p>And should that bhikkhunī, thus admonished by the bhikkhunīs, persist as before, the bhikkhunīs are to rebuke her up to three times so as to desist. If while being rebuked up to three times she desists, that is good. If she does not desist, then this bhikkhunī, also, as soon as she has fallen into the third act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

<p>Recited, venerables, are the seventeen saṅghadisesas, nine being offences at once and eight after the third [admonition]. If a bhikkhuni has commited one or other of these offences, she must spend half a month on penance before both Saṅghas. When the bhikkhuni has completed the penance, she is to be reinstated by a bhikkhuni Saṅgha of twenty. If a bhikkhuni Saṅgha of one less than twenty should soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings reinstate that bhikkhuni, that bhikkhuni is not reinstated and those bhikkhunis are censurable. This is the proper course here. Herein I ask the venerables: Are you pure in this? A second time I ask: Are you pure in this? A third time I ask: Are you pure in this? The venerables are pure in this; therefore they are silent. So I remember it.</p>

<p><b><a id="np-2"></a>2.</b> Should any bhikkhunī, having determined an out-of-season cloth to be an in-season cloth, distribute it, it is to be forfeited and confessed. (§¶•) <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">When a Community's kathina privileges are in effect, all cloth presented to the their residence is in-season cloth, and it is to be distributed only among the residents who spent the Rains-residence in that residence and participated in the spreading of the kathina (see Mv.VII.1.3). Other bhikkhunīs have no share in it. However, if donors wish to give cloth to those other bhikkhunīs, they can declare their intention, in which the cloth — even though given "in-season" — counts as out-of-season cloth. In this case, the later arrivals have a right to a share. In the origin story to this rule, donors make such a gift. The offending bhikkhunī, not wanting to share the gift with the later arrivals for whom it was intended, declares it to be in-season cloth, and shares it only with the bhikkhunīs who spent the Rains-residence in that residence.</span></span></span></p>

<p><b><a id="np-3"></a>3.</b> Should any bhikkhunī, having exchanged robe-cloth with another bhikkhunī, later say to her, "Here, lady. This is your robe-cloth.

Having accepted it, she is to make it up immediately (into a cloth requisite). But should it not be enough, she may lay it aside for a month at most if she has an expectation for filling the lack. If she should keep it beyond that, even when she has an expectation (for further cloth), it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>

<p><b><a id="np-16"></a>16 [<a href="../vi/bu-pt.html#np-6">6</a>].</b> Should any bhikkhunī ask for robe-cloth from a man or woman householder unrelated to her, except at the proper occasion, it is to be forfeited and confessed. Here the proper occasion is this: The bhikkhunī's robe has been snatched away or destroyed. This is the proper occasion here.</p>

<p><b><a id="np-17"></a>17 [<a href="../vi/bu-pt.html#np-7">7</a>].</b> If that unrelated man or woman householder presents the bhikkhunī with many robes (pieces of robe-cloth), she is to accept at most (enough for) an upper and a lower robe.

May the lady accept this robe fund," then the bhikkhunī is to tell the messenger: "We do not accept robe funds, my friend. We accept robes (robe-cloth) as are proper according to season."</p>

<p>If the messenger should say to the bhikkhunī, "Does the lady have a steward?" then, bhikkhunīs, if the bhikkhunī desires a robe, she may indicate a steward — either a monastery attendant or a lay follower — (saying,) "That, sir, is the bhikkhunīs' steward."</p>

<p>If the messenger, having instructed the steward and going to the bhikkhunī, should say, "I have instructed the steward the lady indicated. May the lady go (to her) and she will clothe you with a robe in season," then the bhikkhunī, desiring a robe and approaching the steward, may prompt and remind her two or three times, "I have need of a robe." Should (the steward) produce the robe after being prompted and reminded two or three times, that is good.</p>

<p>If she should not produce the robe, (the bhikkhunī) should stand in silence four times, five times, six times at most for that purpose. Should (the steward) produce the robe after (the bhikkhunī) has stood in silence for the purpose four, five, six times at most, that is good.</p>

<p>If she should not produce the robe (at that point), should she then produce the robe after (the bhikkhunī) has endeavored further than that, it is to be forfeited and confessed.</p>

<p>If she should not produce (the robe), then the bhikkhunī herself should go to the place from which the robe fund was brought, or a messenger should be sent (to say), "The robe fund that you, venerable sirs, sent for the sake of the bhikkhunī has given no benefit to the bhikkhunī at all.

<p id="pc-44"><b>44.</b> <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">BD misinterprets not only the rule here, but also its explanatory material in the Bhikkhunī Vibhaṅga. The Pali of the rule is: <i>Ya pana bhikkhunī gihi-veyyavaccam kareyya, pacittiyanti.</i> BD translates it as: "Whatever nun should do household work, there is an offence of expiation." <i>Gihi,</i> however, means lay person or, more literally, "house-person," not household. This is confirmed by the word-commentary's definition of <i>gihi-veyyavaccam:</i> "She cooks conjey or a meal or a non-staple food, or washes a piece of clothing or a head-wrap for a person living in a house <i>(agarika)."</i><br>In the non-offense clauses, BD translates <i>attano veyyavaccakarassa</i> as "in doing household work for herself." This omits the <i> –kara-</i> in the second term, thus changing <i>veyyavaccakara</i> (chore-doer) to <i>veyyavacca</i> (chore). The correct translation is, "for her own chore-doer."</span></span></span>Should any bhikkhunī do a chore for a lay person, it is to be confessed. (§¶•) <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Thus the non-offense clauses, as a set, read: "There is no offense in conjey-drink, in a Community meal, in homage to a chedi, or if she cooks conjey or a meal or a non-staple food, or washes a piece of clothing or a head-wrap for her own chore-doer." The Commentary explains: <b>"In conjey-drink, etc.:</b> When people are making a Community meal or a conjey-drink for the purpose of the Community, there is no offense in her doing any cooking at all in the position of being their friend. <b>In homage to a chedi:</b> It is all right if, being a friend, she does homage with scents, etc. <b>For her own chore-doer:</b> Even if (her) mother and father come and are making/doing something (such as) a fan or a broom handle and so stand in the position of a chore-doer, it is all right to cook anything (for them)."</span></span></span></p>

Thus the twelve years here apparently refers to the candidate's having been married for twelve years. The word for "married" in the rule — <i>gihigataa</i> — is not normally used for formal marriage. The Vibhaṅga explains it with the term <i>purisantaragataa,</i> which means a woman living with a man (see <a href="../dn/dn8.html#p14">DN8</a>).

In the origin story for this rule, the offending bhikkhunī dismisses the group that had received consent to carry out the Acceptance transaction and then — under the ruse of the consent given to that group — convenes another group of bhikkhus less likely to pay attention to the deficiencies in the candidate she is proposing.

<p>Recited, venerables, are the rules of training. Herein I ask the venerables: Are you pure in this? A second time I ask the venerables: Are you pure in this? A third time I ask the venerables: Are you pure in this? The venerables are pure in this; therefore they are silent. So I remember it.</p>

<p class="verse">The section on training is finished.</p>

<h3 id="as">Adhikaraṇa-Samatha</h3>

<p>Now, venerables, these seven matters for the settlement of issues come up for recitation.</p>

<p>For the settling and pacification of issues that have arisen:</p>

<hr>
<p><b><a id="as-1"></a>1.</b> <i>A verdict "in the presence of" should be given.</i> <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This means that the transaction settling the issue must be carried out in the presence of the Community, in the presence of the individuals, and in the presence of the Dhamma and Vinaya.</span></span></span></p>

<p><b><a id="as-2"></a>2.</b> <i>A verdict of mindfulness may be given.</i> <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the verdict of innocence given in an accusation, based on the fact that the accused remembers fully that she did not commit the offense in question.</span></span></span></p>

<p><b><a id="as-3"></a>3.</b> <i>A verdict of past insanity may be given.</i> <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is another verdict of innocence given in an accusation, based on the fact that the accused was out of her mind when she committed the offense in question and so is absolved of any responsibility for it.</span></span></span></p>

<p><b><a id="as-4"></a>4.</b> <i>Acting in accordance with what is admitted</i>. <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This refers to the ordinary confession of offenses, where no formal interrogation is involved. The confession is valid only if in accord with the facts, e.g., a bhikkhunī actually commits a pācittiya offense and then confesses it as such, and not as a stronger or lesser offense. If she were to confess it as a dukkata or a Saṅghādisesa, that would be invalid.</span></span></span></p>

<p><b><a id="as-5"></a>5.</b> <i>Acting in accordance with the majority.</i> <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This refers to cases in which bhikkhunīs are unable to settle a dispute unanimously, even after all the proper procedures are followed, and — in the words of the Canon — are "wounding one another with weapons of the tongue." In cases such as these, decisions can be made by majority vote.</span></span></span></p>

<p><b><a id="as-6"></a>6.</b> <i>Acting for her (the accused's) further punishment.</i> <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This refers to cases where a bhikkhunī admits to having committed the offense in question only after being formally interrogated about it. She is then to be reproved for her actions, made to remember the offense and to confess it, after which the Community carries out a "further punishment" transaction against her as an added punishment for being so uncooperative as to require the formal interrogation in the first place.</span></span></span></p>

<p><b><a id="as-7"></a>7.</b> <i>Covering over as with grass.</i> <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This refers to situations in which both sides of a dispute realize that, in the course of their dispute, they have done much that is unworthy of a contemplative. If they were to deal with one another for their offenses, the only result would be greater divisiveness. Thus if both sides agree, all the bhikkhunīs gather in one place. (According to the Commentary, this means that all bhikkhunīs in the Community territory <i>(sima)</i> must attend. No one should send her consent, and even sick bhikkhunīs must go.) A motion is made to the entire group that this procedure will be followed. One member of each side then makes a formal motion to the members of her faction that she will make a confession for them. When both sides are ready, the representative of each side addresses the entire group and makes the blanket confession, using the form of a motion and one announcement (<i>ñatti-dutiya-kamma</i>). </span></span></span></p>

<p>Recited, venerables, are the seven matters of the settlement of issues. Herein I ask the venerables: Are you pure in this? A second time I ask: Are you pure in this? A third time I ask: Are you pure in this? The venerables are pure in this; therefore they are silent. So I remember it.</p>

<hr>
<p class="verse">The settlement of issues is finished.</p>

<p id="p294"><span class="parno">294</span>Recited, venerables, is the introduction, recited are the eight matters entailing defeat, recited are the seventeen matters entailing initial and subsequent [meetings] of the community, recited are the thirty matters entailing confession with forfeiture, recited are the one hundred and sixty-six matters entailing confession, recited are the eight matters to be acknowledged, recited are the rules for training, recited are the seven matters for the settlement of issues. So much, come down in the sutta of the Blessed One, contained in the sutta, comes up for recitation every half month. Herein all are to train – united, in agreement, not disputing.</p>
