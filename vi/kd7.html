<div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time thirty monks from Pāvā—all wilderness-dwellers, almsfood eaters, rag-robe wearers, and three-robe owners—were traveling to Sāvatthī to visit the Buddha. Because the entry to the rainy-season residence was approaching, they were unable to reach Sāvatthī, and they entered the rains residence at Sāketa while still on their way. They spent the rains residence discontented, thinking: “The Buddha is only 80 kilometers away, yet we don’t get to see him.”</p>

<p>When they had completed the rainy-season residence and done the invitation ceremony at the end of the three months, it was raining, with water and mud everywhere. As they traveled to Sāvatthī, they were exhausted, their robes soaked. When they arrived at Sāvatthī, they went to Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, bowed to the Buddha, and sat down. </p>

<hr>

<p>Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks the Buddha said to them:</p>

<hr>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>“I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re getting by. I hope you had a comfortable rains, that you lived together in peace and harmony, and got almsfood without trouble?”</p>

<p>“We’re keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re getting by. We had a comfortable rains, lived together in peace and harmony, and had no trouble getting almsfood.” They told the Buddha what had happened during the rains and while traveling to Sāvatthī.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:</p>

<p class='rule'>“I allow monks who have completed the rainy-season residence to participate in a robe-making ceremony. Once you have participated in the robe-making ceremony, five things are allowable for you: Going without informing, going without taking, eating in a group, as much robe-cloth as you need, and whatever robe-cloth is given there is for you.</p>

<p>And the robe-making ceremony should be performed like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha:</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. This cloth has been given to the Saṅgha for the robe-making ceremony. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should give this cloth to monk so-and-so to perform the robe-making ceremony. This is the motion.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. This cloth has been given to the Saṅgha for the robe-making ceremony. The Saṅgha gives this cloth to monk so-and-so to perform the robe-making ceremony. Any monk who approves of giving this cloth to monk so-and-so to perform the robe-making ceremony should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>The Saṅgha has given this cloth to monk so-and-so to perform the robe-making ceremony. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’</p>

<hr>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>“And, monks, how has the robe-making ceremony not been performed? The robe-making ceremony hasn’t been performed merely by marking the cloth, merely by washing the cloth, merely by planning the robe, merely by cutting the cloth, merely by tacking the cloth, merely by sewing a hem, merely by marking with a strip of cloth, merely by strengthening, merely by adding a border lengthwise, merely by adding a border crosswise, merely by adding a patch, merely by partial dyeing; nor has it been performed if a monk has made an indication, if a monk has given a hint, if the robe-cloth has been borrowed, if it has been stored, if it is to be relinquished, if it hasn’t been marked, if it’s not an outer robe or an upper robe or a sarong; nor has it been performed if the robe hasn’t been made on that very day with five or more cut sections with panels, if the robe-making ceremony isn’t performed by an individual, or if the robe-making ceremony has been performed correctly but the appreciation for the ceremony is expressed outside the monastery zone. In this way the robe-making ceremony hasn’t been performed.</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>And how has the robe-making ceremony been performed? The robe-making ceremony has been performed if the cloth is brand new, if it’s nearly new, if it’s old, if it’s a rag, if it’s from a shop; it has been performed if a monk hasn’t given a sign, if a monk hasn’t given a hint, if the robe-cloth hasn’t been borrowed, if it hasn’t been stored, if it’s not to be relinquished, if it has been marked, if it’s an outer robe or an upper robe or a sarong; it has been performed if the robe has been made on that very day with five or more cut sections with panels, if the robe-making ceremony is performed by an individual, and if the robe-making ceremony has been performed correctly and the appreciation for the ceremony is expressed inside the monastery zone. In this way the robe-making ceremony has been performed.</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>And how does the robe season come to an end? There are these eight key phrases for when the robe season comes to an end: when he departs from the monastery, when the robe is finished, when he makes a decision, when the robe-cloth is lost, when he hears about the end of the robe season, when an expectation of more robe-cloth is disappointed, when he is outside the monastery zone, ending together.”</p>

<h4>14. Discussion on obstacles and removal of obstacles</h4>

<p id="p137"><span class="parno">137</span>“Monks, there are two obstacles for the ending of the robe season:  the monastery obstacle and the robe obstacle. What’s the monastery obstacle? A monk stays in that monastery or he leaves intending to return.  What’s the robe obstacle? A monk hasn’t made a robe, or he hasn’t finished it, or he’s expecting more robe-cloth. </p>

<p id="p138"><span class="parno">138</span>There are two removals of obstacles for the ending of the robe season: the removal of the monastery obstacle and the removal of the robe obstacle. What’s the removal of the monastery obstacle? A monk leaves that monastery without intending to return.  What’s the removal of the robe obstacle? A monk has made a robe; or the robe-cloth is lost, destroyed, or burnt; or his expectation of more robe-cloth is disappointed.” </p>
