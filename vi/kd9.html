 <section class="raw_sutta">

 <div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā lotus pond. At that time in the country of Kāsī there was a village called Vāsabha with a resident monk called Kassapagotta. He was dedicated to the local monastery, trying to get good monks to come, to help those who had come be comfortable, and to make the local monastery grow and reach maturity. </p>

<p>At this time a number of monks who were wandering in Kāsī arrived at Vāsabha. When Kassapagotta saw those monks coming, he prepared seats, and he set out a foot stool, a foot scraper, and water for washing the feet. He then went out to meet them, received their bowls and robes, and asked if they wanted water to drink. He made sure they had a bath, and he helped them get rice porridge, fresh foods, and meals. Those newly arrived monks thought: “He’s great, this resident monk, in that he helps us with all these things. Let’s settle down right here in Vāsabha.” And they did just that. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Soon afterwards Kassapagotta thought: “These monks are now rid of their tiredness from traveling. And by now they know where to get alms. Also, in the long run it’s hard work to seek support from unrelated folk, and people don’t like to be asked. Why don’t I stop helping them get rice porridge, fresh foods, and meals?” And he did. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Those newly arrived monks considered: “Previously this resident monk made sure we got a bath, and he helped us get rice porridge, fresh foods, and meals. But now he’s stopped. He’s become hostile, this resident monk. Well then, let’s eject him.” </p>

<p>Soon afterwards those newly arrived monks gathered and confronted Kassapagotta with what had happened, adding: “You’ve committed an offense. Do you recognize it?” </p>

<p>“No. I haven’t committed any offense that I should recognize.” </p>

<hr>

<p>Those newly arrived monks then ejected Kassapagotta for not recognizing an offense. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Kassapagotta thought: “I don’t actually know whether this was an offense or not, whether I’ve committed one or not, whether I’ve been ejected or not, whether it was legitimate or not, whether it’s reversible or not, whether it’s fit to stand or not. Let me go to Campā and ask the Buddha.” </p>

<p>He then put his dwelling in order, took his bowl and robe, and set out for Campā. When he eventually arrived, he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, the Buddha said to Kassapagotta: “I hope you’re keeping well, monk, I hope you’re getting by.  I hope you’re not tired from traveling.  And where have you come from?” </p>

<p>“I’m keeping well, Venerable Sir, I’m getting by. I’m not tired from traveling.” And he told the Buddha all that had happened, adding, 


<hr>

<p>“That’s where I’ve come from.” </p>

<p>“Well, that’s not an offense, monk, and you haven’t been ejected. You’ve been ejected by an illegitimate legal procedure that’s reversible and unfit to stand. Go back and stay right there in the village of Vāsabha.” </p>

<p>“Yes, Sir.” He got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and set out for Vāsabha. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>Soon those newly arrived monks became anxious and remorseful: “It’s truly bad for us that we have ejected, without reason, a pure monk who hadn’t committed any offense. Well then, let’s go to Campā and confess our mistake to the Buddha.” </p>

<p>They then put their dwellings in order, took their bowls and robes, and set out for Campā. When they eventually arrived, they went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, the Buddha said to them: “I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re getting by.  I hope you’re not tired from traveling.  And where have you come from?” </p>

<p>“We’re keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re getting by. We’re not tired from traveling. There’s a village in the country of Kāsī called Vāsabha. That’s where we’ve come from.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Are you the ones who ejected the resident monk?” </p>

<p>“Yes, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“For what reason?” </p>

<p>“Without any reason.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them: “Foolish men, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you, without reason, eject a pure monk who hadn’t committed any offense? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not, without reason, eject a pure monk who hasn’t committed any offense. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Those monks then got up from their seats, put their upper robe over one shoulder, bowed down with their heads at the Buddha’s feet, and said: “Venerable Sir, we have made a mistake. We’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful in ejecting, without reason, a pure monk who hadn’t committed any offense. Please accept our confession so that we may restrain ourselves in the future.” </p>

<p>“You have certainly made a mistake. You’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful. But since you acknowledge your mistake and make proper amends, I forgive you. For this is called growth in the training of the noble ones: acknowledging a mistake, making proper amends, and undertaking restraint for the future.” </p>

<h4>2. Discussion of illegitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly, etc. </h4>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>At that time the monks at Campā did legal procedures such as these: illegitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly, illegitimate legal procedures done by a unanimous assembly, legitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly, legitimate-like legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly, legitimate-like legal procedures done by a unanimous assembly, one person ejecting another, one ejecting two, one ejecting three, one ejecting a saṅgha, two ejecting one, two ejecting two, two ejecting three, two ejecting a saṅgha, three ejecting one, three ejecting two, three ejecting three, three ejecting a saṅgha, a saṅgha ejecting a saṅgha. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks at Campā do such legal procedures?” </p>

<p>They told the Buddha. … “Is it true, monks, that the monks at Campā do this?” 
</p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>The Buddha rebuked them, It’s not suitable for those foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How can they do such legal procedures? 
This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>
<ul>
<li class="rule">“Illegitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly are invalid and not to be done. </li>

<li class="rule">Three ejecting a saṅgha is invalid and not to be done. </li>
<li class="rule">A saṅgha ejecting a saṅgha is invalid and not to be done. </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p id="12"><span class="parno">12</span>There are four kinds of legal procedures: an illegitimate legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly, an illegitimate legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly, a legitimate legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly, and a legitimate legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly. </p>

<ul>
<li class="rule">The illegitimate legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly is reversible and unfit to stand, because it’s illegitimate and the assembly is incomplete. You shouldn’t do such procedures. I haven’t allowed such procedures. </li>
<li class="rule">The illegitimate legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly is reversible and unfit to stand, because it’s illegitimate. You shouldn’t do such procedures. I haven’t allowed such procedures. </li>
<li class="rule">The legitimate legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly is reversible and unfit to stand, because the assembly is incomplete. You shouldn’t do such procedures. I haven’t allowed such procedures. </li>
<li class="rule">The legitimate legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly is irreversible and fit to stand, because it’s legitimate and the assembly is unanimous. You should do such procedures. I have allowed such procedures. </li>
</ul>

<p>And so, monks, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will perform legitimate legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly.’” </p>

<h4>3. Discussion of legal procedures deficient in motion, etc. </h4>

<p id="13"><span class="parno">13</span>At that time the monks from the group of six did legal procedures such as these: illegitimate procedures done by an incomplete assembly; illegitimate procedures done by a unanimous assembly; legitimate procedures done by an incomplete assembly; legitimate-like procedures done by an incomplete assembly; legitimate-like procedures done by a unanimous assembly; procedures deficient in motion but complete in announcement; procedures deficient in announcement but complete in motion; procedures deficient in both motion and announcement; procedures not done according to the Teaching; procedures not done according to the Monastic Law; procedures not done according to the Teacher’s instructions; procedures that had been objected to, that were illegitimate, reversible, and unfit to stand. </p>

<hr>

<p id="14"><span class="parno">14</span>The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks from the group of six do such legal procedures?” </p>

<hr>

<p>They told the Buddha. … “Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six do this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them … He then gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p id="17"><span class="parno">17</span>And, monks, there are six kinds of legal procedures: illegitimate legal procedures, legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly, legal procedures done by a unanimous assembly, legitimate-like legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly, legitimate-like legal procedures done by a unanimous assembly, legitimate legal procedures done by a unanimous assembly. </p>

<hr>

<p id="18"><span class="parno">18</span>What’s an illegitimate legal procedure? </p>

<p>If a procedure requires one motion and one announcement, but they do it with one motion and no announcement, it’s an illegitimate legal procedure.

If a procedure requires one motion and one announcement, but they do it with one announcement and no motion, it’s an illegitimate legal procedure. If a procedure requires one motion and one announcement, but they do it with two announcements and no motion, it’s an illegitimate legal procedure. </p>

<p>
If a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, but they do it with one motion and no announcement, it is an illegitimate legal procedure. If a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, but they do it with two motions and no announcement, it’s an illegitimate legal procedure. If a procedure requires one motion and three announcements, but they do it with three motions and no announcement, it’s an illegitimate legal procedure.
