<p class="namo"><span class="parno">1</span>Homage to the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One </p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Soon after his awakening, the Buddha was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the river Nerañjara at the foot of a Bodhi tree.There the Buddha sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom.Then, in the first part of the night, the Buddha reflected on dependent origination in forward and reverse order: </p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>“Ignorance is the condition for intentional activities; intentional activities are the condition for consciousness; consciousness is the condition for name and form; name and form are the condition for the six sense spheres; the six sense spheres are the condition for contact; contact is the condition for feeling; feeling is the condition for craving; craving is the condition for grasping; grasping is the condition for existence; existence is the condition for birth; birth is the condition for old age and death, for grief, sorrow, pain, aversion, and distress to come to be.This is how there is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. </p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>But with the complete fading away and end of ignorance comes the end of intentional activities; with the end of intentional activities comes the end of consciousness; with the end of consciousness comes the end of name and form; with the end of name and form comes the end of the six sense spheres; with the end of the six sense spheres comes the end of contact; with the end of contact comes the end of feeling; with the end of feeling comes the end of craving; with the end of craving comes the end of grasping; with the end of grasping comes the end of existence; with the end of existence comes the end of birth; with the end of birth comes the end of old age and death, and the end of sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and distress.This is how there is the end of this whole mass of suffering.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha uttered a heartfelt exclamation: </p>

	<div class="verse">
		<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>
“When things become clear
			<br>To the energetic brahmin who practices absorption,
			<br>Then all his doubts are dispelled,
			<br>Since he understands the natural order and its conditions.”</p>
	</div>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>In the middle part of the night, the Buddha again reflected on dependent origination in forward and reverse order: “Ignorance is the condition for intentional activities; intentional activities are the condition for consciousness; consciousness is the condition for name and form …This is how there is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. …This is how there is the end of this whole mass of suffering.” </p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha uttered a heartfelt exclamation: </p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>“When things become clear
<br>To the energetic brahmin who practices absorption,
<br>Then all his doubts are dispelled,
<br>Since he’s understood the end of the conditions.”</p>
</div>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>In the last part of the night, the Buddha again reflected on dependent origination in forward and reverse order: “Ignorance is the condition for intentional activities; intentional activities are the condition for consciousness; consciousness is the condition for name and form …This is how there is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. …This is how there is the end of this whole mass of suffering.” </p>

<hr>

<p>11Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha uttered a heartfelt exclamation: </p>
	
	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>“When things become clear
			<br>To the energetic brahmin who practices absorption,
			<br>He defeats the army of the Lord of Death,
			<br>Like the sun beaming in the sky.”</p>
	</div>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">13</span>The account with the Bodhi tree is finished. </p>

<h4>2. The account with the goatherd’s banyan tree </h4>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>After seven days, the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the Bodhi tree to a goatherd’s banyan tree. There too he sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom. </p>

<p>Then a conceited brahmin went up to the Buddha,exchanged pleasantries with him, 

and said: “Good Gotama, how is one a brahmin? What are the qualities that make one a brahmin?” </p>

<hr>

<p>Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha uttered a heartfelt exclamation: </p>

	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>“The brahmin who has shut out bad qualities,
			<br>Who is humble, free from flaws, and self-controlled,
			<br>Who has reached final knowledge and has fulfilled the spiritual life—
			<br>He may rightly proclaim himself a brahmin,
			<br>Having no conceit about anything in the world.”</p>
	</div>

<p class="end"><span class="parno">16</span>The account with the goatherd’s banyan tree is finished. </p>

<h4>3. The account with the powderpuff tree </h4>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>After seven days, the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the goatherd’s banyan tree to a powderpuff tree. There too he sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom. </p>

<p>Just then an unseasonal storm was approaching, bringing seven days of rain, cold winds, and clouds. Mucalinda, the dragon king, came out from his abode. He encircled the body of the Buddha with seven coils and spread his large hood over his head, thinking: “May the Buddha not be hot or cold, nor be bothered by horseflies or mosquitoes, by the wind or the burning sun, or by creeping animals or insects.” </p>

<p>After seven days, when he knew the sky was clear, Mucalinda unraveled his coils from the Buddha’s body and transformed himself into a young brahmin. He then stood in front of the Buddha, raising his joined palms in veneration. </p>

<p>Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha uttered a heartfelt exclamation: </p>

<hr>

	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>“Seclusion is bliss for the contented
			<br>Who sees the Teaching that they have learned.
			<br>Kindness to the world is happiness,
			<br>For one who’s harmless to living beings.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>Dispassion for the world is happiness,
			<br>For one who overcomes sensuality.
			<br>But removing the conceit ‘I am’,
			<br>This, indeed, is the highest bliss.”</p>
			</div>

<p class="end"><span class="parno">20</span>The account with the powderpuff tree is finished. </p>

<h4>4. The account with the ape-flower tree </h4>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>After seven days, the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the powderpuff tree to an ape-flower tree. There too he sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom. </p>

<p>Just then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika were traveling from Ukkala to that area. Then a god who was a former relative of theirs said to them: “Sirs, a Buddha who has just attained awakening is staying at the foot of an ape-flower tree. Go to that Buddha and offer him baked goods and honey. That will be for your benefit and happiness for a long time.” </p>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>And they took baked goods and honey and went to the Buddha. They bowed down and said: “Venerable Sir, please accept the baked goods and honey from us. That will be for our benefit and happiness for a long time.” </p>

<p>The Buddha thought: “Buddhas don’t receive with their hands. In what should I receive the baked goods and honey?” </p>

<p>Then, reading the mind of the Buddha, the four great kings offered him four crystal bowls from the four directions, saying: “Here, Sir, please receive the baked goods and honey in these.” After receiving the baked goods and honey in one of the valuable crystal bowls, the Buddha ate them. </p>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>When Tapussa and Bhallika knew that the Buddha had finished his meal, they bowed down with their head at his feet, and said: “Sir, we go for refuge to the Buddha and the Teaching. Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” By means of the double refuge, they became the first lay followers in the world. </p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">24</span>The account with the ape-flower tree is finished. </p>

<h4>5. The account of the supreme being’s request </h4>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>After seven days, the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the ape-flower tree to a goatherd’s banyan tree, and he stayed there. </p>

<p>Then, while reflecting in private, the Buddha thought this: “I have discovered this profound truth, so hard to see, so hard to comprehend. It’s peaceful and sublime, subtle, beyond the intellect, and knowable only to the wise. But human beings delight in holding on, find pleasure in holding on, rejoice in holding on, and because of that it’s hard for them to see causal relationships, dependent origination. This too is very hard for them to see: the stilling of all intentional activities, the giving up of all ownership, the stopping of craving, fading away, ending, extinguishment. If I were to teach this truth, others would not understand, and that would be wearying and troublesome for me.” </p>

<p>And spontaneously, these verses never heard before occurred to the Buddha: </p>

<hr>

	<div class="verse">
		<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>“What I’ve discovered with difficulty,
			<br>There’s no point in making it known.
			<br>For those overcome by sensual desire and ill will,
			<br>This truth is hard to understand.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>Those who are excited by sensual desire,
			<br>Obstructed by a mass of darkness,
			<br>Won’t see what goes against the stream,
			<br>What’s subtle and refined, profound and hard to see.”</p>
	</div>

<hr>

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>When the Buddha reflected like this, he inclined to inactivity, not to teaching. </p>

<p>29Just then the supreme being Sahampati read the mind of the Buddha. He thought: “The world is lost; it’s perished!—for the Buddha, perfected and fully awakened, inclines to inaction, not to teaching.” </p>

<p>Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch his arm, Sahampati disappeared from the world of supreme beings and appeared in front of the Buddha. </p>

<p>He put his upper robe over one shoulder, placed his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms, and said: “Please teach, Venerable Sir, please teach! There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are ruined because of not hearing the Teaching. There will be those who understand.” </p>

<p>This is what Sahampati said, and he added: </p>

<hr>

	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p30"><span class="parno">30</span>“Earlier, among the Magadhans,
			<br>An impure teaching appeared, conceived by defiled people.
			<br>Open this door to the deathless!
			<br>Let them hear the Teaching, discovered by the Pure One.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p31"><span class="parno">31</span>Just as one standing on a rocky mountain top
			<br>Would see the people all around,
			<br>Just so, All-seeing Wise One,
			<br>Ascend the temple of the Truth.
			<br>Being rid of sorrow, look upon the people,
			<br>Sunk in grief, overcome by birth and old age.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p32"><span class="parno">32</span>Stand up, Victorious Hero!
			<br>Leader of travelers, wander the world without obligation.
			<br>Sir, proclaim the Teaching;
			<br>There will be those who understand.”</p>
	</div>

<hr>

<p id="p33-48"><span class="parno">33-48</span>Twice the Buddha repeated to Sahampati what he had thought, and on both occasions Sahampati repeated his request. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p49"><span class="parno">49</span>The Buddha understood the request of that supreme being. Then, with the eye of a Buddha, he surveyed the world out of compassion for sentient beings. He saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in their eyes, with sharp faculties and with dull faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and difficult to teach. He even saw some who regarded the next world as dangerous and to be avoided, while others did not. </p>

<hr>

<p>It was just like blue, red, and white lotuses, sprouted and grown in a lotus pond: some remain submerged in the water without rising out of it, others reach the surface of the water, while others still rise out of the water without being touched by it. </p>

<hr>

<p>When he had seen this, the Buddha replied to Sahampati in verse: </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p50"><span class="parno">50</span>“Open to them are the doors to the deathless!
<br>May those who hear release their faith.
<br>Seeing trouble, supreme being,
<br>I did not speak the sublime and subtle Truth.”</p>
</div>

<p id="p51"><span class="parno">51</span>Sahampati thought: “The Buddha has consented to teach.” He bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and disappeared right there. </p>

<p class="endsection" id="p52"><span class="parno">52</span>The account of the supreme being’s request is finished. </p>

<h4>6. The account of the group of five </h4>

<p id="p53"><span class="parno">53</span>The Buddha thought: “Who should I teach first? Who will understand this Teaching quickly?” And it occurred to him: “Ālāra Kālāma is wise and competent, and has for a long time had little dust in his eyes. Let me teach him first. He will understand it quickly.” </p>

<p>But an invisible god informed the Buddha: “Sir, Ālāra Kālāma died seven days ago,” and the Buddha also knew this for himself. He thought: “Ālāra Kālāma’s loss is great. If he had heard this Teaching, he would have understood it quickly.” </p>

<p id="p54"><span class="parno">54</span>Again the Buddha thought: “Who should I teach first? Who will understand this Teaching quickly?” And it occurred to him: “Udaka Rāmaputta is wise and competent, and has for a long time had little dust in his eyes. Let me teach him first. He will understand it quickly.” </p>

<p>But an invisible god informed the Buddha: “Sir, Udaka Rāmaputta died last night,” and the Buddha also knew this for himself. He thought: “Udaka Rāmaputta’s loss is great. If he had heard this Teaching, he would have understood it quickly.” </p>

<p id="p55"><span class="parno">55</span>Once again the Buddha thought: “Who should I teach first? Who will understand this Teaching quickly?” And it occurred to him: “The group of five monks who supported me while I was striving were of great service to me. Let me teach them first. </p>

<p>But where are they staying now?” </p>

<p>With his superhuman and purified clairvoyance, the Buddha saw that the group of five monks were staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana. Then, after staying at Uruvelā for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Benares. </p>

<p id="p56"><span class="parno">56</span>The Ājīvaka ascetic Upaka saw the Buddha traveling between Gayā and the place of awakening. He said to the Buddha: “Sir, your senses are clear and your skin is pure and bright. In whose name have you gone forth? </p>

<p>Who is your teacher or whose teaching do you follow?” </p>

<p>The Buddha replied to Upaka in verse: </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p57"><span class="parno">57</span>“I’m the victor, the knower of all.
<br>Abandoning all, I’m not soiled by anything.
<br>Through my own insight, I’m freed by the ending of craving—
<br>So who should I refer to as a teacher?</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p58"><span class="parno">58</span>I have no teacher;
<br>No-one like me exists.
<br>In the world with its gods,
<br>I have no equal.</p>
</div>

	<div class="verse">
		<p id="p59"><span class="parno">59</span>For I’m the Perfected One,
			<br>The supreme teacher.
			<br>I alone am fully awakened;
			<br>I’m cool and extinguished.</p>
	</div>
			
	<div class="verse">
		<p id="p60"><span class="parno">60</span>I’m going to the city of Kāsi,
			<br>To set rolling the wheel of the Teaching.
			<br>In this world immersed in darkness,
			<br>I’ll beat the drum of the deathless.”</p>
			</div>

<hr>

<p id="p61"><span class="parno">61</span>“According to your own claim you must be a universal conqueror.” </p>

	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p62"><span class="parno">62</span>“Indeed, those like me are conquerors,
			<br>Those who have ended the corruptions.
			<br>I have conquered all bad traits
			<br>Therefore, Upaka, I’m a conqueror.”</p>

<p id="p63"><span class="parno">63</span>Saying: “May it be so,” Upaka shook his head, chose the wrong path, and left. </p>

<p id="p64"><span class="parno">64</span>The Buddha continued wandering toward the deer park at Isipatana near Benares. When he eventually arrived, he went to the group of five monks. </p>

<p>Seeing him coming, the group of five made an agreement with one another: “Here comes the ascetic Gotama, who has given up his striving and returned to a life of indulgence. We shouldn’t bow down to him, stand up for him, or receive his bowl and robe, but we should prepare a seat. If he wishes, he may sit down.” </p>

<p>But as the Buddha approached, the group of five monks was unable to keep their agreement. One went to meet him to receive his bowl and robe, another prepared a seat, another set out water for washing the feet, yet another set out a foot stool, and the last one put out a foot scraper. The Buddha sat down on the prepared seat and washed his feet. But they still addressed him by name and as “friend”. </p>

<p id="p65"><span class="parno">65</span>The Buddha said to the group of five monks: “Monks, don’t address the Buddha by name or as ‘friend’. Listen, I’m perfected and fully awakened. I have discovered the deathless. I will instruct you and teach you the Truth. When you practice as instructed, in this very life you will soon realize with your own insight the supreme goal of the spiritual life for which gentlemen rightly go forth into homelessness.” </p>

<p>They replied: “Friend Gotama, by practicing extreme austerities you didn’t gain any superhuman quality, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of noble ones. Since you have given up your striving and returned to a life of indulgence, how could you now have achieved any of this?” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha said: “I haven’t given up striving and returned to a life of indulgence,” and he repeated what he had said before. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p66"><span class="parno">66</span>A second time the group of five monks repeated their question and a second time the Buddha repeated his reply.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p67"><span class="parno">67</span>A third time they repeated their question and the Buddha then said: “Have you ever heard me speak like this?” </p>

<p>“No, Sir.” </p>

<p>“Then listen. I’m perfected and fully awakened. I have discovered the deathless. I will instruct you and teach you the Truth. When you practice as instructed, in this very life you will soon realize with your own insight the supreme goal of the spiritual life for which gentlemen rightly go forth into homelessness.” </p>

<p>The Buddha was able to persuade the group of five monks. They then listened to the Buddha, paid careful attention, and applied their minds to understand. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p68"><span class="parno">68</span>And the Buddha addressed them: </p>

<p><p id="p69"><span class="parno">69</span>“There are these two opposites that should not be pursued by one who has gone forth. One is the devotion to worldly pleasures, which is inferior, crude, common, ignoble, and unbeneficial. The other is the devotion to self-torment, which is painful, ignoble, and unbeneficial. By avoiding these opposites, I have awakened to the middle path, which produces vision and knowledge, which leads to peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. </p>

<hr>

<p>70And what, monks, is that middle path? It’s just this noble eightfold path, that is, right view, right aim, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right stillness. </p>

<hr>

<p>71And this is noble truth of suffering: birth is suffering, old age is suffering, sickness is suffering, death is suffering, association with what is disliked is suffering, separation from what is liked is suffering, not getting what you want is suffering. In brief, the five aspects of existence affected by grasping are suffering. </p>

<p>72And this is noble truth of the origin of suffering: the craving that leads to rebirth, that comes with delight and sensual desire, ever delighting in this and that, that is, craving for worldly pleasures, craving for existence, and craving for non-existence. </p>

<p>73And this is noble truth of the end of suffering: the full fading away and ending of that very craving; giving it up, relinquishing it, releasing it, letting it go. </p>

<p>74And this is noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering: just this noble eightfold path, that is, right view, right aim, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right stillness. </p>

<p>75I knew that this is the noble truth of suffering. Vision, knowledge, wisdom, understanding, and light arose in me regarding things I had never heard before. I knew that this noble truth of suffering should be fully understood. Vision, knowledge, wisdom, understanding, and light arose in me regarding things I had never heard before. I knew that this noble truth of suffering had been fully understood. Vision, knowledge, wisdom, understanding, and light arose in me regarding things I had never heard before. </p>

<p>76I knew that this is the noble truth of the origin of suffering. Vision, knowledge, wisdom, understanding, and light arose in me regarding things I had never heard before. I knew that this noble truth of the origin of suffering should be fully abandoned. Vision, knowledge, wisdom, understanding, and light arose in me regarding things I had never heard before. I knew that this noble truth of the origin of suffering had been fully abandoned. Vision, knowledge, wisdom, understanding, and light arose in me regarding things I had never heard before. </p>

<p>77I knew that this is the noble truth of the end of suffering. Vision, knowledge, wisdom, understanding, and light arose in me regarding things I had never heard before. I knew that this noble truth of the end of suffering should be fully experienced. Vision, knowledge, wisdom, understanding, and light arose in me regarding things I had never heard before. I knew that this noble truth of the end of suffering had been fully experienced. Vision, knowledge, wisdom, understanding, and light arose in me regarding things I had never heard before. </p>

<p>78I knew that this is the noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering. Vision, knowledge, wisdom, understanding, and light arose in me regarding things I had never heard before. </p>

<p>I knew that this noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering should be fully developed. Vision, knowledge, wisdom, understanding, and light arose in me regarding things I had never heard before. I knew that this noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering had been fully developed. Vision, knowledge, wisdom, understanding, and light arose in me regarding things I had never heard before. </p>

<p>79So long as I had not fully purified my knowledge and vision according to reality of these four noble truths with their three stages and twelve characteristics, I didn’t claim the supreme full awakening in this world with its gods, lords of death, and supreme beings, in this society with its monastics and brahmins, its gods and people. </p>

<p>80But when I had fully purified my knowledge and vision according to reality of these four noble truths with their three stages and twelve characteristics, then I did claim the supreme full awakening in this world with its gods, lords of death, and supreme beings, in this society with its monastics and brahmins, its gods and people. And knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘My freedom is unshakable, this is my last birth, now there is no further rebirth.’” </p>

<p>This is what the Buddha said. The monks from the group of five were pleased and they rejoiced in the Buddha’s exposition. </p>

<p>81And while this exposition was being spoken, Venerable Koṇḍañña experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>

<p>82When the Buddha had set rolling the wheel of the Teaching, the earth gods cried out: “At Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has set rolling the supreme wheel of the Teaching. It can’t be stopped by any monastic, brahmin, god, lord of death, supreme being, or anyone in the world.” Hearing the earth gods, the gods of the four great kings cried out … Hearing the gods of the four great kings, the gods of the Thirty-three cried out … the Yāma gods … the contented gods … the gods who delight in creation … the gods who control the creations of others … the gods of the realm of the supreme beings cried out: “At Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has set rolling the supreme wheel of the Teaching. It can’t be stopped by any monastic, brahmin, god, lord of death, supreme being, or anyone in the world.” </p>

<p>83In that instant the news spread as far as the world of the supreme beings. Ten thousand solar systems shook and trembled. And there appeared in the world an immeasurable and glorious radiance, surpassing the splendor of the gods. </p>

<p>84Then the Buddha uttered a heartfelt exclamation: “Koṇḍañña has understood! Indeed, Koṇḍañña has understood!” That’s how Koṇḍañña got the name “Aññāsikoṇḍañña”: “Koṇḍañña who has understood.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p85"><span class="parno">85</span>Aññāsikoṇḍañña had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it. He had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. He then said to the Buddha: “Venerable Sir, I wish to receive the going forth in your presence. I wish to receive the full ordination.” </p>

<p>The Buddha replied: “Come, monk. The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” That was the full ordination of that venerable. </p>

<p id="p86"><span class="parno">86</span>The Buddha then instructed and taught the rest of the monks. While they were being instructed and taught, Venerable Vappa and Venerable Bhaddiya experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>

<p>They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it. They had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. They then said to the Buddha: “Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence. We wish to receive the full ordination.” </p>

<p>The Buddha replied: “Come, monks. The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” That was the full ordination of those venerables. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p87"><span class="parno">87</span>Living on the food brought to him, the Buddha then instructed and taught the remaining monks. The six of them lived on the almsfood brought by three. </p>

<p>While they were being instructed and taught, Venerable Mahānāma and Venerable Assaji experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>

<p>They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; they had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. They then said to the Buddha: “Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence. We wish to receive the full ordination.” </p>

<p>The Buddha replied: “Come, monks. The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” That was the full ordination of those venerables. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p88"><span class="parno">88</span>Then the Buddha addressed the group of five: </p>

<p id="p89"><span class="parno">89</span>“Form is not your essence. For if form were your essence, it would not lead to suffering, and you could make it be like this and not be like that. But because form is not your essence, it leads to suffering, and you can’t make it be like this and not be like that. </p>

<p id="p90"><span class="parno">90</span>Feeling is not your essence. For if feeling were your essence, it would not lead to suffering, and you could make it be like this and not be like that. But because feeling is not your essence, it leads to suffering, and you can’t make it be like this and not be like that. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p91"><span class="parno">91</span>Perception is not your essence. For if perception were your essence, it would not lead to suffering, and you could make it be like this and not be like that. But because perception is not your essence, it leads to suffering, and you can’t make it be like this and not be like that. </p>

<p id="p92"><span class="parno">92</span>Intentional activities are not your essence. For if intentional activities were your essence, they would not lead to suffering, and you could make them be like this and not be like that. But because intentional activities are not your essence, they lead to suffering, and you can’t make them be like this and not be like that. </p>

<p id="p93"><span class="parno">93</span>Consciousness is not your essence. For if consciousness were your essence, it would not lead to suffering, and you could make it be like this and not be like that. But because consciousness is not your essence, it leads to suffering, and you can’t make it be like this and not be like that. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p94"><span class="parno">94</span>What do you think, monks: is form permanent or impermanent?” </p>

<p>“Impermanent, Sir.” </p>

<p>“Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Suffering.” </p>

<p>“And that which is impermanent, suffering, and changeable by nature, is it proper to regard it like this: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my essence?’” </p>

<p>“Definitely not.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p95"><span class="parno">95</span>“What do you think: is feeling permanent or impermanent?” “Impermanent.” “Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?” “Suffering.” “And that which is impermanent, suffering, and changeable by nature, is it proper to regard it like this: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my essence?’” “Definitely not.” </p>

<p id="p96"><span class="parno">96</span>“What do you think: is perception permanent or impermanent?” “Impermanent.” “Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?” “Suffering.” “And that which is impermanent, suffering, and changeable by nature, is it proper to regard it like this: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my essence?’” “Definitely not.” </p>

<p id="p97"><span class="parno">97</span>“What do you think: are intentional activities permanent or impermanent?” “Impermanent.” “Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?” “Suffering.” “And that which is impermanent, suffering, and changeable by nature, is it proper to regard it like this: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my essence?’” “Definitely not.” </p>

<p id="p98"><span class="parno">98</span>“What do you think: is consciousness permanent or impermanent?” “Impermanent.” “Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?” “Suffering.” “And that which is impermanent, suffering, and changeable by nature, is it proper to regard it like this: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my essence?’” “Definitely not.” </p>

<p id="p99"><span class="parno">99</span>“So, whatever form there is—whether past, present, or future, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near—it should all be seen with right wisdom according to reality: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my essence.’ </p>

<p id="p100"><span class="parno">100</span>Whatever feeling there is—whether past, present, or future, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near—it should all be seen with right wisdom according to reality: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my essence.’ </p>

<p id="p101"><span class="parno">101</span>Whatever perception there is—whether past, present, or future, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near—it should all be seen with right wisdom according to reality: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my essence.’ </p>

<p id="p102"><span class="parno">102</span>Whatever intentional activities there are—whether past, present, or future, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near—they should all be seen with right wisdom according to reality: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my essence.’ </p>

<p id="p103"><span class="parno">103</span>Whatever consciousness there is—whether past, present, or future, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near—it should all be seen with right wisdom according to reality: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my essence.’ </p>

<p id="p104"><span class="parno">104</span>A learned noble disciples who sees this is repelled by form, repelled by feeling, repelled by perception, repelled by intentional activities, and repelled by consciousness. Being repelled, they become desireless. Because they are desireless, they are freed. When they are freed, they know they are freed. They understand that birth has come to an end, that the spiritual life has been fulfilled, that the job has been done, that there is no further state of existence.” </p>

<p id="p105"><span class="parno">105</span>This is what the Buddha said. The monks from the group of five were pleased and they rejoiced in the Buddha’s exposition. And while this exposition was being spoken to the monks from the group of five, their minds were freed from the corruptions through letting go. </p>


<hr>

<p>Then there were six perfected ones in the world. </p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">106</span>The account of the group of five is finished. 
<br>The first section for recitation is finished. </p>

<h4>7. The account of the going forth </h4>

<p id="107"><span class="parno">107</span>At that time in Benares there was a gentleman called Yasa, the son of a wealthy merchant, who had been brought up in great comfort. </p>

<p>He had three stilt houses: one for the winter, one for the summer, and one for the rainy season. While Yasa was spending the four months of the rainy season in the rainy-season house, he was attended on by female musicians, and he did not come down from that house. On one occasion, while he was enjoying himself with worldly pleasures, he fell asleep before his attendants. He then woke up first, while the oil lamp was still burning. </p>

<p>He saw his attendants sleeping: one with a lute in her armpit, another with a tabor on her neck, still another with a drum in her armpit; one with hair disheveled, another drooling, still another talking in her sleep. It was like a charnel ground before his very eyes. When he saw this, the problem became clear, and a feeling of repulsion stayed with him. He uttered a heartfelt exclamation: “Oh the oppression! Oh the affliction!” </p>

<p id="108"><span class="parno">108</span>He then put on his golden shoes and went to the entrance door. Spirits opened the door, thinking: “No-one should create any obstacle for Yasa going forth into homelessness.” He went to the town gate, and again it was opened by spirits.</p> 

<p>He then went to the deer park at Isipatana. </p>

<hr>

<p id="109"><span class="parno">109</span>Just then, after getting up early in the morning, the Buddha was doing walking meditation outside. When the Buddha saw Yasa coming, he stepped down from his walking path and sat down on the prepared seat. </p>

<p>As he was getting close to the Buddha, Yasa uttered the same heartfelt exclamation: “Oh the oppression! Oh the affliction!” </p>

<p>The Buddha said: “This isn’t oppressive, Yasa, this isn’t afflictive. Come and sit down. I’ll give you a teaching.” </p>

<p>Thinking: “Apparently this isn’t oppressive, apparently it’s not afflictive!” excited and joyful, Yasa removed his shoes, approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. </p>

<p id="110"><span class="parno">110</span>The Buddha then gave Yasa a progressive talk on generosity, morality, and heaven; on the danger, degradation, and defilement of worldly pleasures; and he revealed the benefits of renunciation. </p>

<p>When the Buddha knew that Yasa’s mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. Just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, so too, while he was sitting right there, Yasa experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>

<p id="111"><span class="parno">111</span>Soon afterwards Yasa’s mother went up to his stilt house. Not seeing him, she went to her husband and said: “I can’t find your son Yasa.” The merchant then dispatched horsemen to the four directions, while he himself went to the deer park at Isipatana. He saw the imprints of the golden shoes on the ground and he followed along. </p>

<hr>

<p>When the Buddha saw the wealthy merchant coming, he thought: “Why don’t I use my supernormal powers so that the merchant, when he sits down, doesn’t see Yasa seated next to him?” And he did just that. </p>

<hr>

<p id="112"><span class="parno">112</span>The merchant approached the Buddha and said: “Sir, have you seen Yasa by any chance?” </p>

<p id="113"><span class="parno">113</span>“Please sit down, householder. Perhaps you’ll get to see Yasa.” </p>

<p>When the merchant heard this, he was elated and joyful. And he bowed and sat down. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p114"><span class="parno">114</span>The Buddha then gave him a progressive talk on generosity, morality, and heaven; on the danger, degradation, and defilement of worldly pleasures; and he revealed the benefits of renunciation. When the Buddha knew that his mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, so too, while he was sitting right there, the merchant experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>

<p id="115"><span class="parno">115</span>He had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it. He had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. And he said to the Buddha: “Wonderful, Venerable Sir, wonderful! Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what’s there just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Saṅgha of monks. Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” He was the first person in the world to become a lay follower by means of the triple refuge. </p>

<p id="116"><span class="parno">116</span>While his father was given this teaching, Yasa reviewed what he had already seen and understood, and his mind was freed from the corruptions through letting go. Realizing what had happened, 

the Buddha thought: “Yasa is incapable of returning to the lower life to enjoy worldly pleasures as he did while still a householder. Let me stop using my supernormal powers.” And he did. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p117"><span class="parno">117</span>The merchant saw Yasa sitting there and he said to him: “Dear Yasa, your mother is grieving and lamenting. Please give her back her life.” </p>

<p>Yasa looked to the Buddha, and the Buddha said to the merchant: “What do you think, householder: suppose the mind of one such as you—who has seen and understood the Truth with the trainee’s knowledge and vision—while he was reviewing what he had already seen and understood, was freed from the corruptions through letting go. Would he be able to return to the lower life to enjoy worldly pleasures as he did while still a householder?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Definitely not.” </p>

<p>“But this is what has happened to Yasa. He is now unable to return to the lower life.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s a great gain for Yasa that his mind has been freed from the corruptions through letting go! Sir, please accept today’s meal from me with Yasa as your attendant.” The Buddha consented by remaining silent. </p>

<p id="p118"><span class="parno">118</span>Knowing that the Buddha had consented, the merchant got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. </p>

<p>Soon after the merchant had left, Yasa said to the Buddha: “Sir, I wish to receive the going forth in your presence. I wish to receive the full ordination.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha said: “Come, monk. The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” That was the full ordination of that venerable. Then there were seven perfected ones in the world. </p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">119</span>The going forth of Yasa is finished. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p120"><span class="parno">120</span>The following morning the Buddha robed, took his bowl and robe, and, with Venerable Yasa as his attendant, went to the house of that merchant, where he sat down on the prepared seat. Yasa’s mother and ex-wife approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. </p>

<p id="p121"><span class="parno">121</span>The Buddha gave them a progressive talk on generosity, morality, and heaven; on the danger, degradation, and defilement of worldly pleasures; and he revealed the benefits of renunciation. When the Buddha knew that their minds were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, so too, while they were sitting right there, they experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>

<p>They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it. They had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. And they said to the Buddha: “Wonderful, Venerable Sir, wonderful! … We go for refuge to the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Saṅgha of monks. Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” And they were the first women in the world to become lay followers by means of the triple refuge. </p>

<p id="p122"><span class="parno">122</span>Yasa’s mother, father, and ex-wife personally served various kinds of fine food to the Buddha and Yasa. When the Buddha had finished his meal, they sat down. The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened them with a teaching, before getting up from his seat and leaving. </p>

<p id="p123"><span class="parno">123</span>Now Yasa had four friends Vimala, Subāhu, Puṇṇaji, and Gavampati who were from the wealthiest merchant families in Benares. When they heard that Yasa had shaved off his hair and beard, put on ocher robes, and gone forth into homelessness, they said to one another: “This must be an extraordinary spiritual path, an extraordinary going forth, for Yasa to have done this.” And they went to Yasa and bowed down to him. </p>

<p id="p124"><span class="parno">124</span>Yasa then took his four friends to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down, and said: “Venerable Sir, these four friends of mine Vimala, Subāhu, Puṇṇaji, and Gavampati are from the wealthiest merchant families in Benares. Please instruct them.” </p>

<p id="p125"><span class="parno">125</span>The Buddha gave them a progressive teaching: on generosity, morality, and heaven; on the danger, degradation, and defilement of worldly pleasures; and he revealed the benefits of renunciation. When the Buddha knew that their minds were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, so too, while they were sitting right there, they experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>

<p>The Buddha said: “Come, monks. The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” That was the full ordination of those venerables. Then, as the Buddha instructed those monks in the Teaching, their minds were freed from the corruptions through letting go. And there were eleven perfected ones in the world. </p>

<hr>

<p class="end"><span class="parno">126</span>The going forth of the four friends is finished. </p>

<p id="p127"><span class="parno">127</span>Fifty of Yasa’s friends from leading families in the countryside also heard that Yasa had shaved off his hair and beard, put on ocher robes, and gone forth into homelessness. They too said to one another: “This must be an extraordinary spiritual path, an extraordinary going forth, for Yasa to have done this.” And they went to Yasa and bowed down to him. </p>

<p id="p128"><span class="parno">128</span>Yasa then took his fifty friends to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down, and said: “Sir, these fifty friends of mine are from leading families in the countryside. Please instruct them.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p129"><span class="parno">129</span>The Buddha then gave them a progressive talk on generosity, morality, and heaven; on the danger, degradation, and defilement of worldly pleasures; and he revealed the benefits of renunciation.

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">130</span>The going forth of the fifty friends is finished. </p>

<h4>8. The account of the Lord of Death </h4>

<p id="p131"><span class="parno">131</span>Then the Buddha addressed those monks: “I’m free from all snares, both human and divine. You, too, are free from all snares, both human and divine. Go wandering, monks, for the benefit and happiness of humanity, out of compassion for the world, for the good, benefit, happiness of gods and humans. You should each go a different way. Proclaim the Teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, that has a true goal and is well articulated. Set out the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life. There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are ruined because of not hearing the Teaching. There will be those who understand. I too will go to Uruvelā, to Senānigama, to proclaim the Teaching.” </p>

<p id="p132"><span class="parno">132</span>Then the Lord of Death, the Evil One, went up to the Buddha and spoke to him in verse: </p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p133"><span class="parno">133</span>“You’re bound by all snares,

<p id="p135"><span class="parno">135</span>“The snare is ethereal,

<p id="p137"><span class="parno">137</span>Then the Lord of Death, the Evil One, thought: “The Buddha knows me, the Happy One knows me,” and sad and miserable he disappeared right there. </p>

<h4>9. Discussion of the going forth and the full ordination </h4>

<p id="p139"><span class="parno">139</span>Soon afterwards, the monks were bringing back, from various regions and countries, people desiring the going forth and the full ordination, thinking: “The Buddha will ordain them.” The monks became tired, as did those seeking ordination. </p>

<hr>

<p>Then, while reflecting in private, the Buddha thought: “Why don’t I allow the monks to give the going forth and the full ordination right there in those various regions and countries?” </p>

<p id="p140"><span class="parno">140</span>In the evening, the Buddha came out from seclusion, gave a teaching, and told the monks what he had thought, adding: </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“I allow you to give the going forth and the full ordination in those various regions and countries. </p>

<p>And, monks, it should be done like this. </p>

<p id="p141"><span class="parno">141</span>First the candidate should shave off his hair and beard and put on ocher robes. He should then put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, and raise his joined palms. He should then be told to say this: </p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">146</span>The discussion of the full ordination through the taking of the three refuges is finished. </p>

<h4>10. The second account of the Lord of Death </h4>

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">147</span>When the Buddha had completed the rainy-season residence, he said to the monks: “Through wise attention and wise right effort, I have reached the supreme freedom, realized the supreme freedom. And you, monks, have done the same.” </p>

<p>Then the Lord of Death, the Evil One, went up to the Buddha and spoke to him in verse: </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p148"><span class="parno">148</span>“You’re bound by the snares of the Lord of Death,

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">151</span>The second account of the Lord of Death is finished. </p>

<h4>11. The account of the fine group of people </h4>

<p id="p152"><span class="parno">152</span>When the Buddha had stayed at Benares for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Uruvelā. At a certain point he left the road, entered a forest grove, and sat down at the foot of a tree. </p>

<p>Just then a fine group of thirty friends and their wives were enjoying themselves in that forest grove. Because one of them did not have a wife, they had brought him a sex worker. While they were all carelessly enjoying themselves, that sex worker took that man’s possessions and ran away. </p>

<p>To help their friend, they all went searching for that woman. And as they walked about that forest grove, they saw the Buddha seated at the foot of a tree. They approached him and said: “Sir, have you seen a woman by any chance?” </p>

<p>“But, young men, why look for a woman?” </p>

<hr>

<p>They told him what had happened. </p>

<hr>

<p>“What do you think is better for you: that you search for a woman, or that you search for yourselves?” </p>

<p>“It’s better that we search for ourselves.” </p>

<p>“Well then, sit down, and I’ll give you a teaching.” </p>

<p>Saying: “Yes, Sir,” those friends bowed to the Buddha and sat down. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p153"><span class="parno">153</span>The Buddha then gave them a progressive talk on generosity, morality, and heaven; on the danger, degradation, and defilement of worldly pleasures; and he revealed the benefits of renunciation. When the Buddha knew that their minds were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, so too, while they were sitting right there, they experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>

<p>They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it. They had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. And they said to the Buddha: “Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence. We wish to receive the full ordination.” </p>

<p>The Buddha said: “Come, monks. The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” That was the full ordination of those venerables. </p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">154</span>The account of the fine group of friends is finished.<br>

<br>The second section for recitation is finished. </p>

<h4>12. The account of the wonders at Uruvelā </h4>

<p id="p155"><span class="parno">155</span>The Buddha continued his wandering and eventually arrived at Uruvelā. At that time there were three dreadlocked ascetics were living there: Uruvelā Kassapa, Nadī Kassapa, and Gayā Kassapa. Uruvelā Kassapa was the leader and chief of five hundred dreadlocked ascetics, Nadī Kassapa of three hundred, and Gayā Kassapa of two hundred. </p>

<p id="p156"><span class="parno">156</span>The Buddha went to the hermitage of Uruvelā Kassapa and said to him: “If it’s not inconvenient for you, Kassapa, may I stay for one night in your fire hut?” </p>

<p>“It’s not inconvenient for me, Great Ascetic, but there’s a fierce and highly venomous dragon king with supernormal powers there. I don’t want it to harm you.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p157-158"><span class="parno">157-158</span>The Buddha asked a second and a third time, and on both occasions Uruvelā Kassapa replied as before. The Buddha then said: “Perhaps it won’t harm me. Come on, Kassapa, let me to stay in the fire hut.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Well then, do as you like.” </p>

<p>The Buddha entered the fire hut and prepared a straw mat. He sat down, crossed his legs, straightened his body, and established mindfulness in front of him. </p>

<p id="p159"><span class="parno">159</span>When the dragon saw that the Buddha had entered, he was displeased and emitted smoke. The Buddha thought: “Let me overpower this dragon, using fire against fire, but without harming it in the slightest way.” </p>

<p>The Buddha then used his supernormal powers so that he, too, emitted smoke. The dragon, not being able to contain his rage, emitted flames. The Buddha entered the fire element and he, too, emitted flames. With both of them emitting flames, it was as if the fire hut was ablaze and burning. Those dreadlocked ascetics gathered around the fire hut, saying: “The Great Ascetic is handsome, but the dragon is harming him.” </p>

<p>The next morning the Buddha had overcome that dragon, using fire against fire, but without harming it in the slightest way. He put it in his almsbowl and showed it to Uruvelā Kassapa: “Here is your dragon, Kassapa, his fire overpowered by fire.” </p>

<p>Uruvelā Kassapa thought: “The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty. Using fire against fire, he has overcome that fierce and highly venomous dragon king with its supernormal powers. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p160"><span class="parno">160</span>At the Nerañjara the Buddha said
<br>To the dreadlocked ascetic Uruvelā Kassapa,
<br>“If it’s convenient for you, Kassapa,
<br>May I stay for a night in your fire hut?”</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p161"><span class="parno">161</span>“It’s convenient for me, Great Ascetic,

</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p162"><span class="parno">162</span>“Perhaps it won’t harm me. Come on, Kassapa,

<br>When he knew the answer was “Yes,”
<br>He entered without fear.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p163"><span class="parno">163</span>Seeing the sage who had entered,
<br>The angry dragon emitted smoke.
<br>With a mind of good will,

<p id="p164"><span class="parno">164</span>Unable to contain his rage,

</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p165"><span class="parno">165</span>With both of them emitting flames,
<br>The fire hut was glowing and blazing.
<br>Looking on, the dreadlocked ascetics said,

<br>But the dragon is harming him.”</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p166"><span class="parno">166</span>Yet the following morning
<br>The dragon’s flames were extinguished,

<p id="p169"><span class="parno">169</span>Because of this wonder of supernormal power, Uruvelā Kassapa gained confidence in the Buddha and said to him: “Great Ascetic, please stay right here. I’ll supply you with food.” </p>

<hr>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">170</span>The first wonder is finished. </p>

<p id="p171"><span class="parno">171</span>Soon afterwards the Buddha stayed in a forest grove not far from Uruvelā Kassapa’s hermitage. Then, when the night was well advanced, the magnificent four great kings approached the Buddha, illuminating the whole forest grove. They bowed down to the Buddha and stood at the four cardinal points, appearing like great bonfires. </p>

<p id="p172"><span class="parno">172</span>The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said: “It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready. And who was it that visited you last night?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“That was the four great kings. They came to me to hear the Teaching.” </p>

<p>Uruvelā Kassapa thought: “The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that even the four great kings go to him to hear the Teaching. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” </p>

<p>The Buddha ate his meal and continued to stay in the same forest grove. </p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">173</span>The second wonder is finished. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p175"><span class="parno">175</span>The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said: “It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready. And who was it that visited you last night?” </p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">176</span>The third wonder is finished. </p>

<hr>

<p id="177"><span class="parno">177</span>Once again when the night was well advanced, Sahampati, the magnificent supreme being, approached the Buddha, illuminating the whole forest grove.

<p id="178"><span class="parno">178</span>The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said: “It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready. And who was it that visited you last night?” </p>

<p>Uruvelā Kassapa thought: “The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that even, Sahampati, the supreme being, goes to him to hear the Teaching. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” </p>

<p>The Buddha ate his meal and continued to stay in the same forest grove. </p>

<hr>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">179</span>The fourth wonder is finished. </p>

<p id="p180"><span class="parno">180</span>At this time Uruvelā Kassapa was holding a great sacrifice, and the whole of Aṅga and Magadha wanted to attend with much food of various kinds. Uruvelā Kassapa considered this 

and thought: “If the Great Ascetic performs a wonder of supernormal power for the great crowd, he will get more gain and honor, whereas I will get less. I hope he doesn’t come tomorrow.” </p>

<p>The Buddha read the mind of Uruvelā Kassapa. He then went to Uttarakuru, collected almsfood there, ate it at the Anotatta lake, and stayed there for the day’s meditation. </p>

<p id="p181"><span class="parno">181</span>The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said: “It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready. And why didn’t you come yesterday? We did think of you and set aside a share of various kinds of food.” </p>

<p>“But, Kassapa, didn’t you think, ‘I hope he doesn’t come tomorrow’? Because I read your mind, I went to Uttarakuru, collected almsfood there, ate it at the Anotatta lake, and stayed there for the day’s meditation.” </p>

<p>Uruvelā Kassapa thought: “The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he can read the minds of others. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” </p>

<p>The Buddha ate his meal and continued to stay in the same forest grove. </p>

<hr>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">182</span>The fifth wonder is finished. </p>

<p id="p183"><span class="parno">183</span>Soon afterwards the Buddha got a rag and he thought: “Where can I wash it?” Reading the Buddha’s mind, Sakka dug a pond with his hand. And he said to the Buddha: “Sir, please wash it here.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha thought: “Where can I beat it?” Reading the Buddha’s mind once again, Sakka placed a boulder there. And he said to the Buddha: “Sir, please beat it here.” </p>

<p>The Buddha thought: “What can I hold onto to get out of this pond?” A god living in an arjun tree read the Buddha’s mind. She then bent down a branch and said to the Buddha: “Sir, please come out by holding onto this.” </p>

<p>The Buddha thought: “Where can I dry this rag?” Reading the Buddha’s mind yet again, Sakka placed another boulder there. And he said to the Buddha: “Sir, please dry it here.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p184"><span class="parno">184</span>The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said: “It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready. But what’s going on? There was no pond here before, but now there is. These boulders were not here before. Who placed them here? And this arjun tree didn’t have a bent branch, but now it does.” </p>

<hr>

<p>When the Buddha told him what had happened, Uruvelā Kassapa thought: “The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that even Sakka, the ruler of the gods, performs services for him. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” The Buddha ate his meal and continued to stay in the same forest grove. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p185"><span class="parno">185</span>The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said: “It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.” </p>

<p>“You just go ahead, Kassapa, I’ll come.” After dismissing him, he took a fruit from a rose-apple tree—the tree after which the Rose-apple Land of India is named—and then arrived first in the fire hut, where he sat down. </p>

<p>When Uruvelā Kassapa saw the Buddha sitting there, he said to him: “Which path did you take? I left first, but you’re already here.” </p>

<p>The Buddha told him what he had done and added: “This rose apple has a good color, and it’s fragrant and delicious, too. You can have it, if you wish.” </p>

<p>“There’s no need. You deserve it and you should have it.” </p>

<p>Uruvelā Kassapa thought: “The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he dismissed me, then took a fruit from a rose-apple tree, and still arrived first in the fire hut. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” </p>

<p>The Buddha ate his meal and continued to stay in the same forest grove. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p186"><span class="parno">186</span>The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said: “It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.” </p>

<p>“You just go ahead, Kassapa, I’ll come.” After dismissing him, he took a fruit from a mango tree not far from the rose-apple tree … he took a fruit from an emblic myrobalan tree not far from the mango tree … he took a fruit from a chebulic myrobalan tree not far from the emblic myrobalan tree … he went to Tāvatiṁsa heaven, took a flower from an orchid tree, and then arrived first in the fire hut, where he sat down. </p>

<hr>

<p>When Uruvelā Kassapa saw the Buddha sitting there, he said to him: “Which path did you take? I left first, but you’re already here.” </p>

<p>Uruvelā Kassapa thought: “The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he dismissed me, then went to Tāvatiṁsa heaven, took an orchid tree flower, and still arrived first in the fire hut. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” </p>

<p id="p187"><span class="parno">187</span>Soon afterwards those dreadlocked ascetics wanted to tend the sacred fire, but were unable to split the logs. They thought: “This must be because of the supernormal powers of the Great Ascetic.” </p>

<p>The Buddha said to Uruvelā Kassapa: “May the logs be split, Kassapa.” </p>

<p>“Yes, may they,” he replied. And five hundred logs were split all at once. </p>

<p>Uruvelā Kassapa thought: “The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he can split logs just like that. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” </p>

<p id="p188"><span class="parno">188</span>Those ascetics still wanted to tend the sacred fire, but were unable to light it. They thought: “This must be because of the supernormal powers of the Great Ascetic.” </p>

<p>“Yes, may they,” he replied. And five hundred fires were lit all at once. </p>

<p>Uruvelā Kassapa thought: “The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he can light fires just like that. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p189"><span class="parno">189</span>When those ascetics had tended the sacred fires, they were unable to extinguish them. They thought: “This must be because of the supernormal powers of the Great Ascetic.” </p>

<p>The Buddha said to Uruvelā Kassapa: “May the fires be extinguished, Kassapa.” </p>

<p>“Yes, may they,” he replied. And the five hundred fires were extinguished all at once. </p>

<p>Uruvelā Kassapa thought: “The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he can extinguish fires just like that. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p190"><span class="parno">190</span>At that time it was midwinter, with cold days and snow. During this period those ascetics emerged from the Nerañjara river, immersed themselves in it, and repeatedly emerged and immersed themselves. </p>

<p>Then the Buddha manifested five hundred pans with hot coals, where those ascetics could warm themselves after coming out of the water. They thought: “These were no doubt created by the supernormal powers of the Great Ascetic.” </p>

<p>Uruvelā Kassapa thought: “The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he can manifest so many pans with hot coals. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” </p>

<p id="p191"><span class="parno">191</span>Soon afterwards an unseasonal storm poured down, producing a great flood. The spot where the Buddha was staying was inundated. The Buddha thought: “Why don’t I drive back the water on all sides and walk on the dry ground in the middle?” And he did. </p>

<p>Uruvelā Kassapa thought: “I hope the Great Ascetic hasn’t been swept away by the water.” Together with a number of ascetics he went by boat to where the Buddha was staying. He saw that the Buddha had driven back the water on all sides and was walking on dry ground in the middle. And he said to the Buddha: “Is that you, Great Ascetic?” </p>

<p>“It’s me, Kassapa.” The Buddha rose up into the air and landed in the boat. Uruvelā Kassapa thought: “The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he can displace the water. But he’s not a perfected one like me.” </p>

<p id="p192"><span class="parno">192</span>Then the Buddha thought: “For a long time this foolish man has thought, ‘The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, but he’s not a perfected one like me.’ Let me stir him up.” And he said to Uruvelā Kassapa: “Kassapa, you’re not a perfected one or on the path to perfection. You don’t have the practice that might make you a perfected one or one on the path to perfection.” </p>

<p id="p193"><span class="parno">193</span>At that Uruvelā Kassapa bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet and said: “Venerable Sir, I wish to receive the going forth in your presence. I wish to receive the full ordination.” </p>

<p>“Kassapa, you’re the leader and chief of five hundred dreadlocked ascetics. Tell them first, so that they may take appropriate action.” </p>

<p id="193"><span class="parno">193</span>Uruvelā Kassapa then went to those ascetics and said: “I wish to practice the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic. Please do whatever you think is appropriate.” </p>

<p>“Sir, we’ve had confidence in the Great Ascetic for a long time. If you are to practice the spiritual life under him, so will all of us.” </p>

<p>Then, after letting their hair and dreadlocks, their carrying pole and bundle, and their fire-worship implements be carried away by the water, they went to the Buddha. They bowed down with their head at his feet and said: “Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence. We wish to receive the full ordination.” </p>

<p>The Buddha said: “Come, monks. The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” And that was the full ordination of those venerables. </p>

<p id="p194"><span class="parno">194</span>Nadī Kassapa saw those things being carried away by the water, and he thought: “I hope my brother is okay.” He dispatched his ascetics, saying: “Go and check on my brother.” Together with the three hundred ascetics he then went to Uruvelā Kassapa and said: “Is this better, Kassapa?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Yes, this is better.” </p>

<p>Then, after letting their hair and dreadlocks, their carrying pole and bundle, and their fire-worship implements be carried away by the water, they went to the Buddha. They bowed down with their head at his feet and said: “Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence We wish to receive the full ordination.” </p>

<p>The Buddha said: “Come, monks. The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” And that was the full ordination of those venerables. </p>

<p id="p195"><span class="parno">195</span>Gayā Kassapa saw those things being carried away by the water, and he thought: “I hope my brothers are okay.” He dispatched his ascetics, saying: “Go and check on my brothers.” Together with the two hundred ascetics he then went to Uruvelā Kassapa and said: “Is this better, Kassapa?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Yes, this is better.” </p>

<p>Then, after letting their hair and dreadlocks, their carrying pole and bundle, and their fire-worship implements be carried away by the water, they went to the Buddha. They bowed down with their head at his feet and said: “Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence. We wish to receive the full ordination.” </p>

<p>The Buddha said: “Come, monks. The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” And that was the full ordination of those venerables. </p>

<p id="p196"><span class="parno">196</span>By an act of supernormal determination the Buddha stopped five hundred logs from being split before splitting them; he stopped fires from being lit before lighting them; he then stopped them from being extinguished before extinguishing them; and he manifested five hundred pans with hot coals. In this way, there were three and a half thousand wonders. </p>


<p id="p197"><span class="parno">197</span>After staying at Uruvelā for as long as he liked, the Buddha went to Gayāsīsa together with that large saṅgha of one thousand monks, all of them previously dreadlocked ascetics, and they stayed there. </p>

<p>Then the Buddha addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p id="p198"><span class="parno">198</span>“Everything is burning. What is that everything that is burning? The eye is burning. Sights are burning. Eye consciousness is burning. Eye contact is burning. Whatever feeling arises because of eye contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful—that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of sensual desire, the fire of ill will, and the fire of confusion; burning with birth, old age, and death; burning with grief, sorrow, pain, aversion, and distress, I say. </p>

<hr>

<p>The ear is burning. Sounds are burning. Ear consciousness is burning. Ear contact is burning.

<p>The tongue is burning. Tastes are burning. Tongue consciousness is burning. Tongue contact is burning.

<hr>

<p id="p199"><span class="parno">199</span>When they see this, the learned noble disciple is repelled by the eye, repelled by sights, repelled by eye consciousness, repelled by eye contact, and repelled by whatever pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling arises because of eye contact. </p>

<p>They are repelled by the ear, repelled by sounds, repelled by ear consciousness, repelled by ear contact, and repelled by whatever pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling arises because of ear contact. </p>

<p>They are repelled by the nose, repelled by smells, repelled by nose consciousness, repelled by nose contact, and repelled by whatever pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling arises because of nose contact. </p>

<p id="p200"><span class="parno">200</span>And while this exposition was being spoken, the minds of those one thousand monks were freed from the corruptions through letting go. </p>

<h4>13. The account of the meeting with Bimbisāra </h4>

<p id="202"><span class="parno">202</span>After staying at Gayāsīsa for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward Rājagaha with that large saṅgha of one thousand monks, all of them previously dreadlocked ascetics. When he eventually arrived, he stayed in the cane grove at the Suppatiṭṭha Shrine. </p>

<p>King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was told: “Sir, the ascetic Gotama, the Sakyan, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, has arrived at Rājagaha and is staying in the cane grove at the Suppatiṭṭha Shrine. That good Gotama has a fine reputation: </p>

<p>‘He is a Buddha, perfected and fully awakened, complete in insight and conduct, happy, knower of the world, supreme leader of trainable people, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, a Buddha. With his own insight he has seen this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, this society with its monastics and brahmins, its gods and humans, and he makes it known to others. He has a Teaching that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. It has a true goal and is well articulated. He sets out a perfectly complete and pure spiritual life.’ It’s good to see such perfected ones.” </p>

<p id="203"><span class="parno">203</span>Then, accompanied by one hundred and twenty thousand brahmin householders from Magadha, King Bimbisāra went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. Among those brahmins, some bowed to the Buddha and then sat down, some exchanged pleasantries with him and then sat down, some raised their joined palms and then sat down, some announced their name and family and then sat down, and some sat down in silence. They thought: “Is the Great Ascetic practicing the spiritual life under Uruvelā Kassapa, or is Uruvelā Kassapa practicing the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic?” </p>

<p>Reading their minds, the Buddha spoke to Venerable Uruvelā Kassapa in verse: </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p204"><span class="parno">204</span>“The resident of Uruvelā, known as The Emaciated One
<br>What did he see that he abandoned the fire?
<br>Kassapa, I ask you this:
<br>Why did you abandon the fire worship?”</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p205"><span class="parno">205</span>“As a reward for the sacrifice, they promise sense pleasures:
<br>Sights, sounds, and tastes, and women, too.
<br>But knowing the stain of ownership,
<br>I found no delight in worship and sacrifice.”</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p206"><span class="parno">206</span>“So your mind didn’t delight there
<br>In sights and sounds, and in tastes, too.
<br>What then, in the world of gods and humans,
<br>Does your mind delight in? Tell me this, Kassapa.”</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p207"><span class="parno">207</span>“I saw the state of peace that is detached from sense existence,
<br>Where there is nothing and no ownership;
<br>It doesn’t change, and can’t be found through another.
<br>That’s why I found no delight in worship and sacrifice.”</p>
</div>

<p id="p208"><span class="parno">208</span>Uruvelā Kassapa got up from his seat, put his upper robe over one shoulder, bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said: “Venerable Sir, you’re my teacher, I’m your disciple; you’re my teacher, I’m your disciple.” </p>

<p>The one hundred and twenty thousand brahmin householders from Magadha thought: “So Uruvelā Kassapa is practicing the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic.” Reading their minds, the Buddha gave them a progressive talk on generosity, morality, and heaven; on the danger, degradation, and defilement of worldly pleasures; and he revealed the benefits of renunciation. When the Buddha knew that their minds were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. </p>

<p>And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, so too, while they were sitting right there, one hundred and ten thousand of those brahmin householders headed by Bimbisāra experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” The remaining ten thousand declared themselves as lay followers. </p>

<p id="p209"><span class="parno">209</span>King Bimbisāra had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it. He had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. He then said to the Buddha: “Venerable Sir, when I was a prince, I had five wishes, and they have now been fulfilled. When I was a prince, I thought, ‘Oh, I wish they would anoint me as the king!’ That was my first wish, which has now been fulfilled. ‘May one who is perfected and fully awakened come to my kingdom!’ That was my second wish, which has now been fulfilled. ‘May I get to visit that Buddha!’ That was my third wish, which has now been fulfilled. ‘May that Buddha give me a teaching!’ That was my fourth wish, which has now been fulfilled. ‘May I understand the Teaching of that Buddha!’ That was my fifth wish, which has now been fulfilled. </p>

<p>Wonderful, Sir, wonderful! Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what’s there just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Saṅgha of monks. Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. And please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Saṅgha of monks.” The Buddha consented by remaining silent. Knowing that the Buddha had consented, the King got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. </p>

<p>The following morning King Bimbisāra had various kinds of fine food prepared. He then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready. </p>

<p id="p210"><span class="parno">210</span>The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and together with a large saṅgha of a thousand monks, all previously dreadlocked ascetics, he entered Rājagaha. </p>

<p>Just then Sakka, the ruler of the gods, had transformed himself into a young brahmin. He walked in front of the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha, chanting these verses: </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="211"><span class="parno">211</span>“The Tamed One with the tamed ones, previously dreadlocked;
<br>The Liberated One with the liberated ones:
<br>Golden in color,
<br>The Buddha entered Rājagaha.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="212"><span class="parno">212</span>The Freed One with the freed ones, previously dreadlocked;
<br>The Liberated One with the liberated ones:
<br>Golden in color,
<br>The Buddha entered Rājagaha.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="213"><span class="parno">213</span>The One Crossed Over with the ones crossed over, previously dreadlocked;
<br>The Liberated One with the liberated ones:
<br>Golden in color,
<br>The Buddha entered Rājagaha.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="214"><span class="parno">214</span>The Peaceful One with the peaceful ones, previously dreadlocked;
<br>The Liberated One with the liberated ones:
<br>Golden in color,
<br>The Buddha entered Rājagaha.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="215"><span class="parno">215</span>He has ten abidings and ten powers;
<br>He knows ten truths and has ten qualities
<br>With a following of ten times one hundred,
<br>The Buddha entered Rājagaha.”</p>
</div>

<hr>

<p id="216"><span class="parno">216</span>People saw Sakka, and they said: “This young brahmin is handsome and graceful. Who is he?” Sakka replied to them in verse: </p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="217"><span class="parno">217</span>“Unwavering and tamed in all respects,
<br>Purified, perfected, and without equal;
<br>The one in the world who is happy
<br>I’m his servant.”</p>
</div>

<p id="218"><span class="parno">218</span>The Buddha then went to King Bimbisāra’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat, together with the Saṅgha of monks. The King personally served various kinds of fine food to the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha. </p>

<p>When the Buddha had finished his meal, the King sat down to one side. And he thought: “Where will the Buddha stay that’s neither too far from habitation nor too close, that has good access roads, that’s easily accessible for people who seek him, that has few people during the day and is quiet at night, that’s free from chatter and offers solitude, a private resting place suitable for seclusion?” </p>

<p>And it occurred to him: “My Bamboo Grove park has all these qualities. Why don’t I give it to the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha?” </p>

<p>The King then took hold of a golden ceremonial vessel and dedicated the park to the Buddha, saying: “I give this park, the Bamboo Grove, to the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha.” The Buddha accepted the park. After instructing, inspiring, and gladdening the King with a teaching, he got up from his seat and left. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow monasteries.” </p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">219</span>The account of the meeting with Bimbisāra is finished. </p>

<h4>14. The account of the going forth of Sāriputta and Moggallāna </h4>

<p id="220"><span class="parno">220</span>At that time the wanderer Sañcaya was staying at Rājagaha with a large group of two hundred and fifty wanderers, including Sāriputta and Moggallāna. The two of them had made an agreement that whoever reached the deathless first would inform the other. </p>

<p id="221"><span class="parno">221</span>Just then, Venerable Assaji robed up in the morning, took his bowl and robe, and entered Rājagaha for almsfood. He was pleasing in his conduct: in going out and coming back, in looking ahead and looking aside, in bending and stretching his arms. His eyes were lowered, and he was perfect in deportment. The wanderer Sāriputta observed all this and thought: “This monk is one of those in the world who are perfected or on the path to perfection. Why don’t I go up to him and ask in whose name he has gone forth, and who his teacher is or whose teachings he follows?” </p>

<p>But it occurred to him: “It’s the wrong time to ask him while he’s walking for almsfood among the houses. Let me follow behind him, for one who seeks the path will find it.” </p>

<p>After walking for alms in Rājagaha, Assaji turned back with his almsfood. Sāriputta then went up to him and exchanged pleasantries with him. And he asked: “Venerable, your senses are clear and your skin is pure and bright. In whose name have you gone forth? Who is your teacher or whose teaching do you follow?” </p>

<p>“There’s a great ascetic, a Sakyan who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan. I’ve gone forth in his name, he’s my teacher, and I follow his teaching.” </p>

<p>“But what does he teach?” </p>

<p>“I’ve only recently gone forth; I’m new to this spiritual path. I’m not able to give you the Teaching in full, but I can tell you the meaning in brief.” </p>

<p>Sāriputta replied: “Yes, please,” and he added: </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="222"><span class="parno">222</span>“Speak little or much,
<br>But do tell me the meaning.
<br>I just want the meaning,
<br>For what’s the point of a detailed exposition?”</p>
</div>

<p id="223"><span class="parno">223</span>And Assaji gave this teaching to the wanderer Sāriputta: </p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="224"><span class="parno">224</span>“Of causally arisen things,
<br>The Buddha has declared their cause,
<br>As well as their ending.
<br>This is the teaching of the Great Ascetic.”</p>
</div>

<p id="225"><span class="parno">225</span>When he had heard this teaching, Sāriputta experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="226"><span class="parno">226</span>“Now this is the truth, even just this much
<br>The sorrowless state that you have penetrated,
<br>Unseen and neglected
<br>For innumerable eons.”</p>
</div>

<p id="p227-230"><span class="parno">227-230</span>Then the wanderer Sāriputta went to the wanderer Moggallāna. When Moggallāna saw him coming, he said to Sāriputta: “Your senses are clear and your skin is pure and bright. You haven’t attained the deathless, have you?” </p>

<p>“I have.” </p>

<p>“But how did it happen?” </p>

<hr>

<p>Sāriputta told him everything up to and including the teaching given by Assaji. </p>

<hr>

<p id="231"><span class="parno">231</span>When he had heard this teaching, Moggallāna experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="232"><span class="parno">232</span>“Now this is the truth, even just this much

</div>

<p id="233"><span class="parno">233</span>Moggallāna said to Sāriputta: “Let’s go to the Buddha. He’s our teacher.” </p>

<p>“But these two hundred and fifty wanderers look to us for support. We must tell them first, so that they may take appropriate action.” And they went to those wanderers and said:</p>

<p>“We’re going over to the Buddha. He’s our teacher.” </p>

<p>“But we look to you for support. If you are to practice the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic, so will all of us.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="234"><span class="parno">234</span>Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna went to Sañcaya and said: “We’re going over to the Buddha. He’s our teacher.” </p>

<p>“Don’t go! The three of us can look after this community together.” </p>

<p>Sāriputta and Moggallāna said the same thing a second time and a third time, 

and they got the same reply. They then took those two hundred and fifty wanderers and went to the Bamboo Grove. But the wanderer Sañcaya vomited hot blood right there. </p>

<hr>

<p id="235"><span class="parno">235</span>When the Buddha saw Sāriputta and Moggallāna coming, he said to the monks:</p>

<p>“The two friends Kolita and Upatissa are coming. They will become my most eminent disciples, an excellent pair.” </p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="236"><span class="parno">236</span>They had not even reached the Bamboo Grove,
<br>Yet had a profound range of knowledge,
<br>About the supreme end of ownership, about freedom.
<br>And the Teacher said of them:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="237"><span class="parno">237</span>“These two friends are coming,
<br>Kolita and Upatissa.
<br>They will be an excellent pair,

</div>

<p id="238"><span class="parno">238</span>Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached the Buddha, bowed down with their heads at the his feet, and said: “Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence. We wish to receive the full ordination.” </p>

<p>The Buddha said: “Come, monks. The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” That was the full ordination of those venerables. </p>

<h4>14.1 The going forth of the well-known </h4>

<p id="239"><span class="parno">239</span>At that time many well-known gentlemen from Magadha who were practicing the spiritual life under the Buddha. People complained and criticized him: “The ascetic Gotama is making us childless; he’s making us widows. He’s breaking up good families! A thousand dreadlocked ascetics have now gone forth because of him, and also these two hundred and fifty wanderers who were disciples of Sañcaya. All these well-known gentlemen from Magadha are practicing the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama.” And when they saw monks, they confronted them with this verse: </p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="240"><span class="parno">240</span>“The Great Ascetic has arrived
<br>At Giribbaja in Magadha.
<br>After leading away all of Sañcaya’s disciples,
<br>Who will he lead away next?”</p>
</div>

<p id="241"><span class="parno">241</span>The monks heard the complaints of those people and they told the Buddha what had happened. … “The complaining will soon stop. It will only go on for seven days. Still, when people confront you like this you can confront them in return with this verse: </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="242"><span class="parno">242</span>‘Indeed, the Great Heroes, the Buddhas,
<br>Lead by means of a good teaching.
<br>When you understand this, what indignation can there be

</div>

<p id="243"><span class="parno">243</span>Soon, when they saw monks, people confronted them with the same verse: </p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="244"><span class="parno">244</span>“The Great Ascetic has arrived
<br>At Giribbaja in Magadha.
<br>After leading away all of Sañcaya’s disciples,

<br>The fourth section for recitation is finished. </p>

<h4>15. Discussion of the proper conduct toward the preceptor </h4>

<p id="251"><span class="parno">251</span>At that time the monks did not have preceptors or teachers, and as a result they were not being instructed. When walking for almsfood, they were shabbily dressed and improper in appearance. While people were eating, they held out their almsbowls to receive leftovers, even right over their food, whether it was cooked or fresh food, delicacies or drinks. They ate bean curry and rice that they themselves had asked for, and they were noisy in the dining hall. </p>

<hr>

<p>People complained and criticized them: “How can the Sakyan monastics act like this? 
They are just like brahmins at a brahminical meal!” </p>

<p id="252"><span class="parno">252</span>The monks heard the complaints of those people. The monks of few desires, who had a sense of conscience, and who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and fond of the training, complained and criticized them: “How can monks act like this?” </p>

<p>
</p>

<p>They then told the Buddha. </p>

<hr>

<p id="253"><span class="parno">253</span>Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that monks act like this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them: “It’s not suitable for those foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How can they act like this? This will affect people’s confidence, and cause some to lose it.” </p>

<hr>

<p>Then the Buddha spoke in many ways in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain, in dispraise of great desires, discontent, socializing, and laziness; but he spoke in many ways in praise of being easy to support and maintain, of fewness of wishes, contentment, self-effacement, ascetic practices, serenity, reduction in things, and being energetic. After giving a teaching on what is right and proper, he addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">254</span>“There should be a preceptor. </p>

<p>The preceptor should think of his student as a son and the student his preceptor as a father. In this way they will respect, esteem, and be considerate toward each other, and they will grow and reach greatness on this spiritual path. </p>

<p>A preceptor should be chosen like this. </p>

<p>After putting his upper robe over one shoulder, a student should pay respect at the feet of the potential preceptor. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, ‘Venerable, please be my preceptor.’ And he should repeat this a second and a third time. If the other conveys the following by body, by speech, or by body and speech: ‘Yes;’ ‘No problem;’ ‘It’s suitable;’ ‘It’s appropriate;’ or, ‘Carry on with inspiration’—then a preceptor has been chosen. If the other doesn’t convey this by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then a preceptor hasn’t been chosen. </p>

<p id="304"><span class="parno">304</span>On a later occasion, a monk misbehaved immediately after his full ordination. The monks told him: “Don’t do that. It’s not allowable.” </p>

<p>“But I didn’t ask you to ordain me. Why did you ordain me without being asked?” </p>

<p id="305"><span class="parno">305</span>They told the Buddha. </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“You should not give the full ordination to someone who hasn’t asked. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow you to give the full ordination to someone who has asked. </p>

<p>And this is how they should ask. After approaching the Saṅgha, the one who wants the full ordination should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: ‘Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha for the full ordination. Please lift me up out of compassion.’ And he should ask a second and a third time. </p>

<hr>

<p id="310"><span class="parno">310</span>At that time in Rājagaha, there was a succession of fine meals. A certain brahmin thought: “These Sakyan monastics have pleasant habits and a happy life. They eat nice food and sleep in beds sheltered from the wind. Why don’t I go forth with the Sakyan monastics?” </p>

<p>Then that brahmin went to the monks and asked for the going forth. The monks gave him the going forth and the full ordination. </p>

<p>When he had gone forth, that succession of meals came to a stop. The monks said to him: “Come, let’s walk for alms.” </p>

<p>“I didn’t go forth to walk for alms. If you give me some, I’ll eat it. If not, I’ll disrobe.” </p>

<p>“But did you go forth for the sake of your stomach?” </p>

<p>“Yes.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The monks of few desires complained and criticized him: “How could a monk go forth on this well-proclaimed spiritual path for the sake of his stomach?” </p>

<hr>

<p id="311"><span class="parno">311</span>They told the Buddha what had happened. … “Is it true, monk, that you did this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you go forth on this well-proclaimed spiritual path for the sake of your stomach? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking him … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“When you are giving the full ordination, you should point out the four supports: </p><ol><li>
One gone forth is supported by almsfood. You should persevere with this for life. There are these additional allowances: a meal for the Saṅgha, a meal for designated monks, an invitational meal, a meal for which lots are drawn, a half-monthly meal, a meal on the observance day, and a meal on the day after the observance day. </li><li>
One gone forth is supported by rag-robes. You should persevere with this for life. There are these additional allowances: linen, cotton, silk, wool, sunn hemp, and hemp. </li><li>
One gone forth is supported by the foot of a tree as resting place. You should persevere with this for life. There are these additional allowances: a dwelling, a stilt house, and a cave. </li><li>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">312</span>The fifth section for recitation on the proper conduct toward the preceptor is finished. </p>

<h4>18. Discussion of the proper conduct toward a teacher </h4>

<p id="313"><span class="parno">313</span>Soon afterwards a young brahmin went to the monks and asked for the going forth. The monks told him about the four supports. He said: “Venerables, if you had told me about this after my going forth, I would have been fine. But now I won’t go forth, for these supports are disgusting and repulsive to me.” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not point out the supports beforehand. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. You should point out the supports immediately after the full ordination.” </p>

<p id="314"><span class="parno">314</span>At that time the monks gave the full ordination in groups of two and three. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not give the full ordination in groups of less than ten. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. You should give the full ordination in groups of ten or more than ten.” </p>

<p id="315"><span class="parno">315</span>At that time monks who only had one or two years of seniority gave the full ordination, among them Venerable Upasena of Vaṅganta. </p>

<p>After completing the rainy-season residence, he had two years of seniority and his student had one. The two of them went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, the Buddha said to Upasena: “I hope you’re keeping well, monk, I hope you’re getting by.  I hope you’re not tired from traveling.” </p>

<p>“I’m keeping well, Venerable Sir, I’m getting by. I’m not tired from traveling.” </p>

<hr>

<p>When Buddhas know what is going on, sometimes they ask and sometimes not. They know the right time to ask and when not to ask. Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, otherwise not, for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial. Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule. </p>

<p>The Buddha said to Upasena: “How long have you been a monk?” </p>

<p>“Two years, Sir.” </p>

<p>“And this monk?” </p>

<p>“One year.” </p>

<p>“And what’s his relationship to you?” </p>

<p>“He’s my student.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked him: “It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. You ought to be taught and instructed by others. What, then, makes you think that you should teach and instruct another person? You have turned to indulgence too readily, that is, by forming a group. This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking him … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not give the full ordination if you have less than ten years of seniority. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow you to give the full ordination if you have ten or more years of seniority.” </p>

<p id="316"><span class="parno">316</span>Then, once they had ten years of seniority, ignorant and incompetent monks gave the full ordination. As a result there were ignorant preceptors with knowledgeable students, incompetent preceptors with competent students, uneducated preceptors with learned students, and foolish preceptors with wise students. A monk who had been a monastic in another religion even refuted his preceptor, despite being legitimately corrected by him. He then returned to that religious community. </p>

<p>The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can ignorant and incompetent monks give the full ordination just because they have ten years of seniority? There are ignorant preceptors with knowledgeable students, incompetent preceptors with competent students, uneducated preceptors with learned students, and foolish preceptors with wise students.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="317"><span class="parno">317</span>They told the Buddha. He said:</p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that this is happening?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them … “How can those foolish men give the full ordination just because they have ten years of seniority? The consequences are evident. This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“An ignorant and incompetent monk should not give the full ordination. If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. I allow a competent and capable monk who has ten or more years of seniority to give the full ordination.” </p>

<p id="318"><span class="parno">318</span>At that time there were preceptors who went away, disrobed, died, or joined another faction, and as a result their students were not being instructed.  When walking for almsfood, they were shabbily dressed and improper in appearance.  While people were eating, they held out their almsbowls to receive leftovers, even right over their food, whether it was cooked or fresh food, delicacies or drinks. They ate bean curry and rice that they themselves had asked for, and they were noisy in the dining hall. </p>

<p>People complained and criticized them: “How can the Sakyan monastics act like this? 
They are just like brahmins at a brahminical meal.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The monks heard the complaints of those people. … They then told the Buddha. “Is it true, monks … ?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” … </p>

<p>After rebuking them, the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">319</span>“There should be a teacher. </p>

<hr>

<p>The teacher should think of his pupil as a son and the pupil his teacher as a father. In this way they will respect, esteem, and be considerate toward each other, and they will grow and reach greatness on this spiritual path. </p>

<p class="rule">You should live with formal support for ten years. And I allow a monk of ten years’ seniority to give such support. </p>

<p>A teacher should be chosen like this: </p>

<p>After putting his upper robe over one shoulder, a pupil should pay respect at the feet of a potential teacher. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, ‘Venerable, please be my teacher. I wish to live with formal support from you.’ And he should repeat this a second and a third time. If the other conveys the following by body, by speech, or by body and speech: ‘Yes;’ ‘No problem;’ ‘It’s suitable;’ ‘It’s appropriate;’ or, ‘Carry on with inspiration’—then a teacher has been chosen. If the other doesn’t convey this by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then a teacher hasn’t been chosen. </p>

<hr>

<p id="320"><span class="parno">320</span>“A pupil should conduct himself properly toward his teacher. This is the proper conduct: </p>

<p id="321"><span class="parno">321</span>Having gotten up at the appropriate time, the pupil should remove his sandals, and put his upper robe over one shoulder. He should then give his teacher a tooth cleaner and water for rinsing the mouth, and he should prepare a seat for him. If there is rice porridge, he should wash a vessel and bring the rice porridge to his teacher. When the teacher has drunk the rice porridge, the pupil should give him water and receive the vessel. Holding it low, he should wash it carefully without scratching it and then put it away. When the teacher has gotten up, the pupil should put away the seat. If the place is dirty, he should sweep it. </p>

<p id="322"><span class="parno">322</span>If the teacher wants to enter the village, the pupil should give him a sarong and receive the one he’s wearing in return. He should give him a belt. He should put the upper robes together, overlapping each other edge-to-edge, and then give them to him. He should wash his teacher’s bowl and give it to him while wet. If the teacher wants an attendant, the pupil should put on his sarong evenly all around, covering the navel and the knees. He should put on a belt. Putting the upper robes together, overlapping each other edge-to-edge, he should put them on and fasten the toggle. He should wash his bowl, bring it along, and be his teacher’s attendant. He shouldn’t walk too far behind his teacher or too close to him. He should receive the contents of his bowl. </p>

<p>He shouldn’t interrupt his teacher when he’s speaking. But if the teacher’s speech is bordering on an offense, he should stop him. </p>

<hr>

<p id="323"><span class="parno">323</span>When returning, the pupil should go first to prepare a seat and to set out a foot stool, a foot scraper, and water for washing the feet. He should go out to meet the teacher and receive his bowl and robe. He should give him a sarong and receive the one he’s wearing in return. If the robe is moist, he should sun it for a short while, but he shouldn’t leave it in the heat. He should fold the robe, offsetting the edges by seven centimeters, so that the fold doesn’t become worn. He should place the belt in the fold. </p>

<p id="324"><span class="parno">324</span>If there is almsfood and his teacher wants to eat, the pupil should give him water and then the almsfood.

<p>The pupil should put away the robe and bowl. When putting away the bowl, he should hold the bowl in one hand, feel under the bed or the bench with the other, and then put it away. He shouldn’t put the bowl away on the bare floor. When putting away the robe, he should hold the robe in one hand, wipe the bamboo robe rack or the clothesline with the other, and then put it away by folding the robe over it, making the ends face the wall and the fold face out. When the teacher has gotten up, the pupil should put away the seat and also the foot stool, the foot scraper, and the water for washing the feet. If the place is dirty, he should sweep it. </p>

When entering the sauna, he should smear his face with clay, cover himself front and back, and then enter. </p>

<p>He shouldn’t sit encroaching on the senior monks, and he shouldn’t block the junior monks from getting a seat. While in the sauna, he should do services for his teacher. When leaving the sauna, he should take the sauna bench, cover himself front and back, and then leave. </p>

<p>And it should be given like this. First he should shave off his hair and beard and put on the ocher robes. He should then put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, and raise his joined palms. He should then be told to say this: </p>

<p id="413"><span class="parno">413</span>He doesn’t have a keen desire for recitation, for questioning, for the higher morality, for the higher mind, or for the higher wisdom. </p>

<p id="414"><span class="parno">414</span>He is displeased when anyone disparages the teacher, the views, the beliefs, the persuasion, or the opinions of the religious community he’s left; but he’s pleased when anyone disparages the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Saṅgha; and he’s pleased when anyone praises the teacher, the views, the beliefs, the persuasion, or the opinions of the religious community he’s left; but he is displeased when anyone praises the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Saṅgha.

I give this special privilege to my relatives.” </p>

<h4>26. The five diseases </h4>

<p id="422"><span class="parno">422</span>At that time in Magadha, there were five common diseases: leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, and epilepsy. When people were sick with any of these, they went to Jīvaka Komārabhacca and said: “Doctor, please treat us.” </p>

<p>He replied: “I’m very busy. I look after King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his harem. I also look after the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha. I’m not able to treat you.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“We’ll give you everything we own, and we’ll be your slave, too. Please treat us, doctor.” </p>

<p>Jīvaka repeated what he had already said. </p>

<hr>

<p>And those people thought: “These Sakyan monastics have pleasant habits and a happy life. They eat nice food and sleep in beds sheltered from the wind. Why don’t we go forth with the Sakyan monastics? If we do, the monks will nurse us and Jīvaka Komārabhacca will treat us.” </p>

<p>They then went to the monks and asked for the going forth. The monks gave them the going forth and the full ordination. And the monks nursed them, and Jīvaka treated them. </p>






<p>At one time the monks were nursing many sick monks. As a result, they kept on asking: “Please give a meal for the sick and for those nursing the sick. Please give medicines for the sick.” And because Jīvaka was treating many sick monks, he was unable to fulfill his duty to the king. </p>

<hr>

<p id="423"><span class="parno">423</span>Then a certain man who was afflicted with one of the five diseases went to Jīvaka and said: “Doctor, please treat me.” </p>

<p>He replied: “I’m very busy. I look after King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his harem. I also look after the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha. I’m not able to treat you.” </p>

<p>“I will give you everything I own, and I’ll be your slave, too. Please treat me, doctor.” </p>

<hr>

<p>Jīvaka repeated what he had already said. </p>

<hr>

<p id="424"><span class="parno">424</span>And that man thought: “These Sakyan monastics have pleasant habits and a happy life. They eat nice food and sleep in beds sheltered from the wind. Why don’t I go forth with the Sakyan monastics? If I do, the monks will nurse me, and Jīvaka Komārabhacca will treat me. And when I’m healthy, I’ll disrobe.” </p>

<p>He then went to the monks and asked for the going forth. The monks gave him the going forth and the full ordination, after which they nursed him and Jīvaka treated him. When he was healthy again, he disrobed. </p>

<p id="425"><span class="parno">425</span>Jīvaka saw that man after he had disrobed, and he asked him: “Didn’t you go forth with the monks?” </p>

<p>“Yes, doctor.” </p>

<p>“And why did you do it?” </p>

<p>When that man had told him what had happened, Jīvaka complained and criticized the monks: “How could the venerables allow one with the five diseases to go forth?” </p>

<p>He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said: “Venerable Sir, it would be good if the venerables didn’t allow those with the five diseases to go forth.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching. Jīvaka then got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not give the going forth to anyone afflicted with any of the five diseases. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<h4>27. Those employed by the king </h4>

<p id="426"><span class="parno">426</span>On one occasion unrest erupted in the outlying districts governed by King Bimbisāra. The King told his generals: “Go and sort out those districts.” </p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>But the most distinguished soldiers thought: “If we go and enjoy the battle, we’ll do what’s bad and make much demerit. How can we avoid what’s bad and do what’s good instead?” </p>

<p id="427"><span class="parno">427</span>It occurred to them: “These Sakyan monastics have integrity. They’re celibate and their conduct is good, and they’re truthful, moral, and have a good character. If we go forth with them, we’ll avoid what’s bad and do what’s good.” Those soldiers then went to the monks and asked for the going forth. And the monks gave them the going forth and the full ordination. </p>

<p>Soon afterwards the generals asked among the King’s employees: “Where are the soldiers so-and-so and so-and-so?” </p>

<p>“They’ve gone forth with the monks.” The generals complained and criticized the monks:</p>

<hr>

<p>“How could the Sakyan monastics give the going forth to those who are employed by the King?” They told the King. </p>

<hr>

<p id="428"><span class="parno">428</span>The King then asked the judges: “What’s the penalty for one who gives the going forth to someone employed by the King?” </p>

<p>“The preceptor should have his head cut off, the one who does the formal proclamation should have his tongue cut out, and the participating group should have half their ribs broken.” </p>

<p>The King went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said: “Venerable Sir, there are kings with little faith and confidence. They would give the monks a hard time even over small matters. It would be good if the venerables didn’t give the going forth to those employed by a king.” The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching. The King then got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not give the going forth to anyone employed by a king. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<h4>28. The criminal Aṅgulimāla </h4>

<p id="429"><span class="parno">429</span>At that time the criminal Aṅgulimāla had gone forth with the monks. When people saw him, they became alarmed and fearful. They turned away, took a different path, ran off, and closed their doors. People complained and criticized the monks: “How could the Sakyan monastics give the going forth to a notorious criminal?” The monks heard the complaints of those people. They then told the Buddha. … </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not give the going forth to a notorious criminal. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<h4>29. The escaped criminal </h4>

<p id="430"><span class="parno">430</span>At that time King Bimbisāra had made the following declaration: “Nothing should be done to anyone who has gone forth with the Sakyan monastics. The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Allow them to practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” </p>

<p>Soon afterwards a certain thief was was put in prison. But he escaped, ran away, and went forth with the monks. When people saw him, they said: “There’s that criminal who escaped from prison. Let’s get him!” But some said: “No, the King has declared that nothing should be done to anyone gone forth with the Sakyan monastics.” </p>

<p>People complained and criticized the monks: “These Sakyan monastics are untouchable; you can’t do anything to them. So how could they give the going forth to an escaped criminal?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not give the going forth to an escaped criminal. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<h4>30. The wanted criminal </h4>

<p id="431"><span class="parno">431</span>On one occasion a certain man stole something, ran away, and then went forth with the monks. Yet the King’s court had issued a statement: “He should be executed wherever he’s seen.” </p>

<p>When people saw him, they said: “There’s that wanted criminal. Let’s execute him!” </p>

<p>But some said: “No, the King has declared that nothing should be done to anyone gone forth with the Sakyan monastics.” </p>

<p>People complained and criticized the monks: “These Sakyan monastics are untouchable; you can’t do anything to them. So how could they give the going forth to a wanted criminal?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“You should not give the going forth to a wanted criminal. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<h4>31. The one who had been whipped </h4>

<p id="432"><span class="parno">432</span>At one time a certain man who had been whipped as a penalty went forth with the monks. People complained and criticized the monks: “How could the Sakyan monastics give the going forth to one who has been whipped as a penalty?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not give the going forth to one who has been whipped as a penalty. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<h4>32. The one who had been branded </h4>

<p id="433"><span class="parno">433</span>At one time a certain man who had been branded as a penalty went forth with the monks. People complained and criticized the monks: “How could the Sakyan monastics give the going forth to one who has been branded as a penalty?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not give the going forth to one who has been branded as a penalty. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<h4>33. The one in debt </h4>

<p id="434"><span class="parno">434</span>On one occasion a certain indebted man ran away and went forth with the monks. Soon afterwards the creditors saw him and said: “There’s that man who owes us. Let’s get him!” </p>

<p>But some said: “No, the King has declared that nothing should be done to anyone gone forth with the Sakyan monastics.” 
</p>

<p>People complained and criticized the monks: “These Sakyan monastics are untouchable; you can’t do anything to them. So how could the Sakyan monastics give the going forth to an indebted person?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not give the going forth to one who is indebted. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<h4>34. The slave </h4>

<p id="435"><span class="parno">435</span>On one occasion a certain slave ran away and went forth with the monks. Soon afterwards the owners saw him and said: “There’s our slave. Let’s get him!” </p>

<p>But some said: “No, the King has declared that nothing should be done to anyone gone forth with the Sakyan monastics.” </p>

<hr>

<p>People complained and criticized the monks: “These Sakyan monastics are untouchable; you can’t do anything to them. So how could the Sakyan monastics give the going forth to a slave?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not give the going forth to a slave. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<h4>35. The shaven-headed smith </h4>

<p id="436"><span class="parno">436</span>At that time a certain shaven-headed smith had quarreled with his parents. He then went to the monastery and went forth with the monks. While looking for their son, the parents came to that monastery. They asked the monks: “Venerables, have you by any chance seen such-and-such a boy?” Because they had not, they said: “No.” </p>

<p>Soon afterwards those parents saw that their son had gone forth as a monk. They then complained and criticized the monks: “These Sakyan monastics are shameless and immoral liars. They deny knowing what they know and having seen what they’ve seen. Our boy has gone forth as a monk.” The monks heard the complaints of those parents. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should get permission from the Saṅgha to shave someone’s head.” </p>

<h4>36. The boy Upāli </h4>

<p id="437"><span class="parno">437</span>At that time in Rājagaha, there was a group of seventeen boys who were friends and had Upāli as their leader. </p>

<p>On one occasion Upāli’s parents thought: “How can we make sure that Upāli is able to live happily without exhausting himself after we’ve passed away? He could become a clerk, but then his fingers will hurt. Or he could become an accountant, but then his chest will hurt. Or he could become a banker, but then his eyes will hurt. These Sakyan monastics, however, have pleasant habits and a happy life. They eat nice food and sleep in beds sheltered from the wind. If Upāli goes forth with them, he’ll be able to live happily without exhausting himself after we’ve passed away.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="438"><span class="parno">438</span>Upāli overheard this conversation between his parents. He then went to the other boys and said: “Come, let’s go forth with the Sakyan monastics.” </p>

<p>“If you go forth, so will we.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The boys went each to his own parents and said: “Please allow me to go forth into homelessness.” Because the parents knew that all the boys had the same desire and good intentions, they gave their approval. The boys then went to the monks and asked them for the going forth, and the monks gave them the going forth and the full ordination. </p>

<hr>

<p>Soon afterwards they got up early in the morning and cried: “Give us rice porridge, give us a meal, give us fresh food!” </p>

<p>The monks said: “Wait until it gets light. If any of that becomes available then, you can have it. If not, you’ll eat after walking for alms.” </p>

<p>But they carried on as before. And they defecated and urinated on the furniture. </p>

<hr>

<p id="439"><span class="parno">439</span>After rising early in the morning, the Buddha heard the sound of those boys. He asked Venerable Ānanda, 

who told him what was happening. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the monks give the full ordination to people they know are less than twenty years old?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them … </p>

<hr>

<p>“How can those foolish men do this? </p>

<hr>

<p>A person who’s less than twenty years old is unable to endure cold and heat; hunger and thirst; horseflies, mosquitoes, wind, and the burning sun; creeping animals and insects; and rude and unwelcome speech. And they’re unable to bear up with bodily feelings that are painful, severe, sharp, and destructive of life. But a person who’s twenty is able to endure these things. This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“You should not give the full ordination to a person you know is less than twenty years old. If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.” </p>

<h4>37. The deadly and contagious disease </h4>

<p id="440"><span class="parno">440</span>At one time most of the members of a particular family had died from a deadly and contagious disease. Only a father and son were left. After going forth as monks, they walked together for alms. Then, when the boy had handed over his almsfood to his father, he said: “Give to me too, daddy!” </p>

<p>People complained and criticized the monks: “These Sakyan monastics are not celibate. This boy was born to a nun!” The monks heard the complaints of those people and they told the Buddha. </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“You should not give the going forth to a boy less than fifteen years old. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<p id="441"><span class="parno">441</span>At that time there was a family with faith and confidence that was supporting Venerable Ānanda. Then most of its members died from a deadly and contagious disease, and only two boys were left behind. When they saw the monks, they ran up to them, as they had done before. When the monks dismissed them, they cried. </p>

<hr>

<p>Ānanda thought: “The Buddha has laid down a rule that a boy less than fifteen years old shouldn’t be given the going forth, which applies to these boys. </p>

<p>How then can I make sure that these boys don’t perish?” He told the Buddha. </p>

<p>“Are they able, Ānanda, to scare away crows?” </p>

<p>“Yes.” The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow you to give the going forth to a boy less than fifteen years old if he’s able to scare away crows.” </p>

<h4>38. Kaṇṭaka </h4>

<p id="442"><span class="parno">442</span>At one time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had two novice monks, Kaṇṭaka and Mahaka. They had sex with each other. The monks complained and criticized them: “How could novice monks misbehave like this?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“A single monk should not have two novice monks attend on him. If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<h4>39. The obscure </h4>

<p id="443"><span class="parno">443</span>At one time the Buddha was staying right there at Rājagaha for the rainy season, for the cold season, and for the hot season. People complained: “The districts are left in darkness and obscurity by the Sakyan monastics. They don’t brighten them up by their presence.” </p>

<p>The monks heard the complaints of those people and told the Buddha. He said to Venerable Ānanda: “Take a key, Ānanda, and go around the yards, informing the monks that the Buddha wishes to go wandering in the Southern Hills. Anyone is welcome to join him.” </p>

<p>Saying: “Yes, Sir,” he did just that. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The monks said: “Ānanda, the Buddha has laid down a rule that one must live with formal support for ten years and that one who has ten years seniority can give such support. If we were to go, we would have to obtain support for a short time, and when we returned, we would have to obtain support once again. So, if our preceptors and teachers go, we’ll go too. If they don’t, neither will we. We don’t want the burden.” </p>

<p>As a result, the Buddha went wandering in the Southern Hills with a small group of monks. </p>

<h4>40. Discussion of release from formal support </h4>

<p id="444"><span class="parno">444</span>After staying in the Southern Hills for as long as he liked, the Buddha returned to Rājagaha. He then asked Ānanda: “Why was it so small, Ānanda, the group of monks that came wandering with me in the Southern Hills?” Ānanda told him what had happened. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“A competent and capable monk should live with formal support for five years, but one who is incompetent should live with formal support for life. </p>




<hr>

<h4>41. Rāhula </h4>

<p id="465"><span class="parno">465</span>After staying at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward Kapilavatthu in the Sakyan country. When he eventually arrived, he stayed in the Banyan Tree Monastery. </p>

<p>In the morning the Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to Suddhodana the Sakyan’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat. The queen, the mother of Rāhula, said to the boy: “This is your father, Rāhula. Go and ask for your inheritance.” Rāhula went up to the Buddha, stood in front of him, and said: “Ascetic, your shadow is pleasant.” When the Buddha got up from his seat and left, Rāhula followed behind, saying “Give me my inheritance! Give me my inheritance!” The Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta: “Well then, Sāriputta, give Rāhula the going forth.” </p>

<p>“But how, Sir?” </p>

<hr>

<p id="466"><span class="parno">466</span>The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“The going forth as a novice monk should be given through the taking of the three refuges. </p>

<hr>

<p>It should be done like this. First the candidate should shave off his hair and beard and put on ocher robes. He should then put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, and raise his joined palms. He should then be told to say this: </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="467"><span class="parno">467</span>‘I go for refuge to the Buddha,
<br>I go for refuge to the Teaching,
<br>I go for refuge to the Saṅgha.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="468"><span class="parno">468</span>For the second time I go for refuge to the Buddha,
<br>For the second time I go for refuge to the Teaching,
<br>For the second time I go for refuge to the Saṅgha.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="469"><span class="parno">469</span>For the third time I go for refuge to the Buddha,
<br>For the third time I go for refuge to the Teaching,
<br>For the third time I go for refuge to the Saṅgha.’”</p>
</div>

<p id="p470"><span class="parno">470</span>“The going forth as a novice monk should be given through the taking of the three refuges. </p>

<p>And Sāriputta gave Rāhula the going forth. </p>

<hr>

<p id="471"><span class="parno">471</span>Soon afterwards Suddhodana went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said: “Sir, I want to ask for a favor.” </p>

<p>“Buddhas don’t grant favors, Gotama.” </p>

<p>“It’s allowable and blameless.” </p>

<p>“Well then, say what it is.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“When the Buddha went forth, it was very painful for me, and the same when Nanda went forth. With Rāhula, it’s even worse. Affection for a child cuts deep. It cuts through the outer and inner skin; it cuts through the flesh, the sinews, and the bones, and it reaches all the way to the bone-marrow. It would be good if the venerables didn’t give the going forth to a child without the parents’ permission.” </p>

<p>The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which Suddhodana got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not give the going forth to a child without the parents’ permission. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<p id="472"><span class="parno">472</span>After staying at Kapilavatthu for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward Sāvatthī. When he eventually arrived, he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. </p>

<p>At this time a family that was supporting Sāriputta sent him a boy with this message: “Please give the going forth to this boy.” </p>

<p>Sāriputta thought: “The Buddha has laid down a rule that a monk shouldn’t have two novices attend on him. I already have the novice Rāhula. So what should I do now?” He told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow a competent and capable monk to have two novice monks attend on him, or however many he’s able to teach and instruct.” </p>

<h4>42. Discussion of the training rules </h4>

<p id="473"><span class="parno">473</span>Soon afterwards the novices thought: “How many training rules do we have that we should train in?” They told the Buddha. … </p>

<p>“There are ten training rules for the novice monks: </p><ol><li class="rule">
Abstention from killing living beings; </li><li class="rule">
Abstention from stealing; </li><li class="rule">
Abstention from sexual activity; </li><li class="rule">
Abstention from lying; </li><li class="rule">
Abstention from alcoholic drinks that cause heedlessness; </li><li class="rule">
Abstention from eating at the wrong time; </li><li class="rule">
Abstention from dancing, singing, music, and seeing shows; </li><li class="rule">
Abstention from wearing garlands and using scents and cosmetics; </li><li class="rule">
Abstention from high and luxurious resting places; </li><li class="rule">
Abstention from receiving gold, silver, or money.” </li></ol><p></p>

<h4>43. Penalties </h4>

<p id="474"><span class="parno">474</span>Soon the novice monks were being disrespectful, undeferential, and rude toward the monks. The monks complained and criticized them: “How can the novices behave like this?” They told the Buddha. … </p>

<p>“I allow you to penalize a novice monk who has five qualities: </p><ol><li class="rule">
He’s trying to stop material support going to monks; </li><li class="rule">
He’s trying to harm monks; </li><li class="rule">
He’s trying to make monks lose their place of residence; </li><li class="rule">
He abuses and reviles monks; </li><li class="rule">
He causes division between monks.” </li></ol><p></p>

<p id="475"><span class="parno">475</span>The monks didn’t know which penalty to impose. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow you to place restrictions on the novice monks.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="476"><span class="parno">476</span>The monks restricted the novices from the whole monastery. Because they were unable to enter the monastery, the novices left, disrobed, and joined the monastics of other religions. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not restrict anyone from a whole monastery. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. </p>

<p class="rule">I allow you to make restrictions for the place you’re staying and its access areas.” </p>

<p id="477"><span class="parno">477</span>The monks placed restrictions on the novices’ food. People making rice porridge and meals for the Saṅgha said to the novices: “Come, Venerables, and drink rice porridge. Come and eat a meal.” </p>

<p>The novices replied: “We can’t. The monks have placed a restriction on us.” </p>

<p>People complained and criticized them: “How can the venerables restrict the novices’ food?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not place restrictions on food. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">478</span>The account of penalties is finished. </p>

<h4>44. Prohibiting without asking permission </h4>

<p id="479"><span class="parno">479</span>On one occasion the monks from the group of six placed restrictions on novices without asking their preceptors for permission. The preceptors could not find their novices. When other monks told them what had happened, the preceptors complained and criticized those monks: “How could the monks from the group of six place restrictions on our novices without asking us for permission?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not place a restriction without asking permission from the preceptor. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<h4>45. Luring away </h4>

<p id="480"><span class="parno">480</span>At one time the monks from the group of six were luring away the novices of the senior monks. The senior monks had to get their own tooth cleaners and water for rinsing the mouth. As a result, they became tired. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not lure away another’s followers. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<h4>46. The novice Kaṇṭaka </h4>

<p id="481"><span class="parno">481</span>At one time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had a novice monk called Kaṇṭaka who raped a nun called Kaṇṭakī. The monks complained and criticized him: “How could a novice monk misbehave in this way?” </p>

<p>They told the Buddha. </p>

<p>“I allow you to expel a novice monk who has ten qualities: </p>

<ol>
	<li class="rule">He kills living beings; </li>
	<li class="rule">He steals; </li>
	<li class="rule">He’s not celibate; </li>
	<li class="rule">He lies; </li>
	<li class="rule">He drinks alcoholic drinks; </li>
	<li class="rule">He disparages the Buddha; </li>
	<li class="rule">He disparages the Teaching; </li>
	<li class="rule">He disparages the Saṅgha; </li>
	<li class="rule">He has wrong view; </li>
	<li class="rule">He has raped a nun.” </li>
</ol>


<h4>47. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Paṇḍakas</i> </h4>

<p id="482"><span class="parno">482</span>At one time a certain <i lang="pi" translate="no">paṇḍaka</i> had gone forth as a monk. He went to the young monks and said: “Come, Venerables, have sex with me.” </p>

<p>The monks dismissed him: “Go away, <i lang="pi" translate="no">paṇḍaka</i>. We don’t want you.” </p>

<hr>

<p>He went to the big and fat novices, said the same thing and got the same response. He then went to the elephant keepers and horse keepers and once again said the same thing. And they had sex with him. </p>

<p>They complained and criticized him: “These Sakyan monastics are <i lang="pi" translate="no">paṇḍakas</i>. And those who are not have sex with them. None of them is celibate.” </p>





<p>The monks heard their complaints. They told the Buddha. </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“A <i lang="pi" translate="no">paṇḍaka</i> should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, they should be expelled.” </p>

<h4>48. The one living in the community by theft </h4>

<p id="483"><span class="parno">483</span>At one time there was a gentleman who had been brought up in comfort, but whose entire family had died. He thought: “I’ve been brought up in comfort and I’m incapable of making money. How can I live happily without exhausting myself?” It occurred to him: “These Sakyan monastics have pleasant habits and a happy life. They eat nice food and sleep in beds sheltered from the wind. Why don’t I just get myself a bowl and robes, shave off my hair and beard, put on ocher robes, and then go to the monastery and live with the monks?”</p>

<p>And he did just that. When he came to the monastery, he bowed down to the monks. The monks asked him:</p>

<p>“How many rains do you have?” </p>

<p>“What does ‘How many rains’ mean?” </p>

<p>“Who’s your preceptor?” </p>

<p>“What’s a preceptor?” </p>

<p>The monks said to Venerable Upāli: “Upāli, please examine this person.” </p>





<p>He then told Upāli what had happened. Upāli told the monks, who in turn told the Buddha. </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“Anyone living in the community by theft should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, they should be expelled. </p>

<p class="rule">Anyone who has previously left to join the monastics of another religion should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, they should be expelled.” </p>

<h4>49. Animals </h4>

<p id="484"><span class="parno">484</span>At one time there was a dragon who was troubled, ashamed, and disgusted with his existence as a dragon. He thought: “How can I get released from this existence and quickly become human?” It occurred to him: “These Sakyan monastics have integrity. They’re celibate and their conduct is good, and they’re truthful, moral, and have a good character. If I were to go forth with them, I would be released from this existence as a dragon and quickly become human.” </p>

<p>Then, taking on the appearance of a young brahmin, that dragon went to the monks and asked for the going forth. The monks gave him the going forth and the full ordination. </p>

<p>Soon afterwards that dragon was sharing a remote dwelling with a certain monk. After getting up early one morning, that monk did walking meditation outside. When the monk had left, the dragon relaxed and fell asleep. As a result, the serpent filled the whole dwelling, its coils even protruding from the windows. </p>

<p>Just then that monk decided to go back inside. When he opened the door, he saw the serpent filling the whole dwelling. Terrified, he screamed. Monks came running to and asked him why he was screaming. </p>

<p>And he told them what had seen. </p>

<p>The dragon woke up from the noise and sat down on his seat. The monks asked him who he was. </p>

<p>He replied: “I’m a dragon.” </p>

<p>“Why did you do this?” And the dragon told them what had happened. </p>

<p>They told the Buddha. </p>

<hr>

<p id="485"><span class="parno">485</span>He then had the Saṅgha of monks gathered and said to the dragon: “Dragons are unable to make progress on this spiritual path. Go, dragon, and keep the observance days of the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth of the lunar half-month. In this way you’ll be released from existence as a dragon and quickly become human.” </p>

<p>When he heard this, the dragon wept. Sad and miserable he cried out in distress and left. </p>

<p>And the Buddha addressed the monks: “There are two occasions when dragons appear in their own form: when they have sexual intercourse with each other, and when they relax and fall asleep. </p>

<p class="rule">Monks, an animal should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, it should be expelled.” </p>

<h4>50. Matricides </h4>

<p id="486"><span class="parno">486</span>At one time there was a young brahmin who had murdered his mother. He was troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by what he had done, and he thought: “How can I escape from this terrible action?” It occurred to him: “These Sakyan monastics have integrity. They’re celibate and their conduct is good, and they’re truthful, moral, and have a good character. If I were to go forth with them, I might be released from this deed.” </p>

<p>He then went to the monks and asked for the going forth. The monks said to Upāli: “Previously a dragon appearing as a young brahmin asked for the going forth. So, please examine this young brahmin, Upāli.” </p>





<p>That young brahmin told Upāli what had happened. Upāli told the monks, who in turn told the Buddha. </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“A matricide should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled.” </p>

<h4>51. Patricides </h4>

<p id="487"><span class="parno">487</span>At one time there was a young brahmin who had murdered his father. He was troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by what he had done, and he thought: “How can I escape from this terrible action?” It occurred to him: “These Sakyan monastics have integrity. They’re celibate and their conduct is good, and they’re truthful, moral, and have a good character. If I were to go forth with them, I might be released from this bad action.” </p>

<p>He then went to the monks and asked for the going forth. The monks said to Upāli: “Previously a dragon appearing as a young brahmin asked for the going forth. So, please examine this young brahmin, Upāli.” </p>





<p>That young brahmin told Upāli what had happened. Upāli told the monks, who in turn told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“A patricide should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled.” </p>

<h4>52. Murderers of perfected ones </h4>

<p id="488"><span class="parno">488</span>On one occasion a number of monks were traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī. While on their way, they were attacked by gangsters. Some of the monks were robbed and some were killed. </p>

<p>Those who had gone forth saw the other being taken away for execution. They said: “It’s good that we escaped. Had we been caught, we would’ve been executed, too.” </p>

<p>The monks asked: “But what have you done?” They told the monks what had happened, and the monks told the Buddha. He said: </p>





<p>“Those monks were perfected ones. </p>

<p id="519"><span class="parno">519</span>Then they were instructed by monks who were ignorant and incompetent. And because they were badly instructed, they were once again embarrassed, humiliated, and unable to respond. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“A monk who is ignorant and incompetent shouldn’t instruct. If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. A monk who is competent and capable should instruct.” </p>

<p id="520"><span class="parno">520</span>They instructed without having been appointed. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“A monk shouldn’t instruct if he hasn’t been appointed to do so. If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. A monk should instruct when he’s been appointed to do so. </p>

<p id="521"><span class="parno">521</span>How is one appointed through oneself? A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<p>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, I will instruct so-and-so.’ </p>

<p>In this way one is appointed through oneself. </p>

<hr>

<p id="522"><span class="parno">522</span>How is one appointed through another? </p>

<p>A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<p>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, so-and-so will instruct so-and-so.’ </p>

<p>In this way one is appointed through another. </p>

<p id="523"><span class="parno">523</span>The monk who has been appointed should go to the one who is seeking the full ordination and say this: </p>

<p>‘Listen, so-and-so. Now is the time for you to tell the truth. When asked in the midst of the Saṅgha about various matters, you should say: “Yes,” if it’s true and: “No,” if it’s not. Don’t be embarrassed or humiliated. This is what they will ask you: “Do you have any of these diseases: leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, or epilepsy? Are you human? Are you a man? Are you free from slavery? Are you free from debt? Are you employed by the King? Do you have your parents’ permission? Are you twenty years old? Do you have a full set of bowl and robes?

<hr>

<p id="524"><span class="parno">524</span>They then came to the Saṅgha together. </p>

<p>The Buddha said: “They should not come together. The instructor should come first and inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<p>He should be told to come. </p>

<hr>

<p id="525"><span class="parno">525</span>He should then put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, and raise his joined palms. He should then ask for ordination: </p>

<p>‘Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha for the full ordination. Please lift me up out of compassion. For the second time, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha for the full ordination. Please lift me up out of compassion. For the third time, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha for the full ordination. Please lift me up out of compassion.’ </p>

<hr>

<p>A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<p>Listen, so-and-so. Now is the time for you to tell the truth. I will ask you about various matters. If something is true, you should say: “Yes,” and if it’s not, you should say: “No.” Do you have any of these diseases: leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, or epilepsy? Are you human? Are you a man? Are you free from slavery? Are you free from debt? Are you employed by the King? Do you have your parents’ permission? Are you twenty years old? Do you have a full set of bowl and robes? What is your name? What is the name of your preceptor?’ </p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">532</span>The procedure of full ordination is finished. </p>

<h4>64. The four supports </h4>

<p id="533"><span class="parno">533</span>“Straightaway the time should be noted and the date should be pointed out. These should be declared jointly to everyone. And the four supports should be pointed out to him: </p>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">534</span>‘One gone forth is supported by almsfood. You should persevere with this for life. There are these additional allowances: a meal for the Saṅgha, a meal for designated monks, an invitational meal, a meal for which lots are drawn, a half-monthly meal, a meal on the observance day, and a meal on the day after the observance day. </p>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">535</span>One gone forth is supported by rag-robes. You should persevere with this for life. There are these additional allowances: linen, cotton, silk, wool, sunn hemp, and hemp. </p>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">536</span>One gone forth is supported by the foot of a tree as resting place. You should persevere with this for life. There are these additional allowances: a dwelling, a stilt house, and a cave. </p>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">537</span>One gone forth is supported by medicine of fermented urine. You should persevere with this for life. There are these additional allowances: ghee, butter, oil, honey, and syrup.’” </p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">538</span>The four supports are finished. </p>

<h4>65. The four things not to be done </h4>

<p id="539"><span class="parno">539</span>On one occasion, the monks gave the full ordination to someone and then departed. The newly ordained monk lagged behind, walking by himself. On the way he met his old wife. She said: “Have you now gone forth?” </p>

<p>“Yes.” </p>

<p>“It’s difficult for those gone forth to get sex. Come, let’s have intercourse.” He had intercourse with her. When he caught up with the monks, they asked him what had taken him so long. He told them what had happened, and they told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“When you have given the full ordination to someone, you should give him a companion and point out the four things not to be done: </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">540</span>A monk who is fully ordained should not have sexual intercourse, even with an animal. If he has sexual intercourse, he’s not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. Just as a man with his head cut off is unable to continue living by reconnecting it to the body, so too is a monk who has had sexual intercourse not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. You shouldn’t do this for as long as you live. </p>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">541</span>A monk who is fully ordained should not steal, even a straw. If he steals a <i lang="pi" translate="no">pāda</i> coin, the worth of a <i lang="pi" translate="no">pāda</i>, or more than a <i lang="pi" translate="no">pāda</i>, he’s not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. Just as a fallen, withered leaf is incapable of becoming green again, so too is a monk who, intending to steal, takes an ungiven <i lang="pi" translate="no">pāda</i> coin, the worth of a <i lang="pi" translate="no">pāda</i>, or more than a <i lang="pi" translate="no">pāda</i> not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. You shouldn’t do this for as long as you live. </p>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">542</span>A monk who is fully ordained should not intentionally kill a living being, even a small insect. If he intentionally kills a human being, even causing an abortion, he’s not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. Just as an ordinary stone that has broken in half cannot be put back together again, so too is a monk who has intentionally killed a human being not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. You shouldn’t do this for as long as you live. </p>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">543</span>A monk who is fully ordained should not claim a superhuman quality, even just saying, ‘I delight in solitude.’ If, because he has bad desires and is overcome by desire, he claims to have a non-existent superhuman quality—whether absorption, release, stillness, attainment, path, or fruit—he’s not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth, so too is a monk with bad desires, overcome by desire, who claims to have non-existent superhuman quality not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. You shouldn’t do this for as long as you live.” </p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">544</span>The four things not to be done are finished. </p>

<h4>66. The one ejected for not recognizing an offense </h4>

<p id="545"><span class="parno">545</span>At one time a certain monk disrobed after being ejected for not recognizing an offense. He then returned and asked the monks for the full ordination. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p id="546"><span class="parno">546</span>“When a monk disrobes after being ejected for not recognizing an offense, but then returns and asks the monks for the full ordination, he should be asked, ‘Will you recognize that offense?’ If he says, ‘I will,’ he should be given the going forth. If he says, ‘I won’t,’ he should not. </p>

<p>When he’s been given the going forth, he should be asked again, ‘Will you recognize that offense?’ If he says, ‘I will,’ he should be given the full ordination. If he says, ‘I won’t,’ he should not. </p>

<p>When he’s been given the full ordination, he should be asked again, ‘Will you recognize that offense?’ If he says, ‘I will,’ he should be reinstated. If he says, ‘I won’t,’ he should not. </p>

<p>When he’s been reinstated, he should be asked again, ‘Do you recognize that offense?’ If he recognizes it, it’s good. If he doesn’t recognize it and you’re unanimous, he should be ejected once more. If you’re not unanimous, there’s no offense in living with him or in doing formal meetings of the community together. </p>






<p id="547"><span class="parno">547</span>“When a monk disrobes after being ejected for not making amends for an offense, but then returns and asks the monks for the full ordination, he should be asked, ‘Will you make amends for that offense?’ If he says, ‘I will,’ he should be given the going forth. If he says, ‘I won’t,’ he should not. </p>

<p>When he’s been given the going forth, he should be asked again, ‘Will you make amends for that offense?’ If he says, ‘I will,’ he should be given the full ordination. If he says, ‘I won’t,’ he should not. </p>

<p>When he’s been given the full ordination, he should be asked again, ‘Will you make amends for that offense?’ If he says, ‘I will,’ he should be reinstated. If he says, ‘I won’t,’ he should not. </p>

<p>When he’s been reinstated, he should be told, ‘Make amends for that offense.’ If he does, it’s good. If he doesn’t and you’re unanimous, he should be ejected once more. If you’re not unanimous, there’s no offense in living with him or in doing formal meetings of the community together. </p>






<p id="548"><span class="parno">548</span>“When a monk disrobes after being ejected for not giving up a bad view, but then returns and asks the monks for the full ordination, he should be asked, ‘Will you give up that bad view?’ If he says, ‘I will,’ he should be given the going forth. If he says, ‘I won’t,’ he should not. </p>

<p>When he’s been given the going forth, he should be asked again, ‘Will you give up that bad view?’ If he says, ‘I will,’ he should be given the full ordination. If he says, ‘I won’t,’ he should not. </p>

<p>When he’s been given the full ordination, he should be asked again, ‘Will you give up that bad view?’ If he says, ‘I will,’ he should be reinstated. If he says, ‘I won’t,’ he should not. </p>

<p>When he’s been reinstated, he should be told, ‘Give up that bad view.’ If he does, it’s good. If he doesn’t and you’re unanimous, he should be ejected once more. If you’re not unanimous, there’s no offense in living with him or in doing formal meetings of the community together.” </p>
