<div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, at the Eastern Monastery in Migāra's mother's mansion. Then at that time the Gracious One was sitting surrounded by the Community of monks on the Observance Day.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then venerable Ānanda, when the night had passed, when the first watch of the night had gone, after rising from his seat, arranging his robe on one shoulder, and raising his hands in respectful salutation, said this to the Gracious One: "The night has passed, reverend Sir, the first watch of the night has gone, for a long time the Community of monks has been sitting, may the Gracious One recite the Pāṭimokkha for the monks."</p>

<p>When that was said, the Gracious One was silent.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>For a second time venerable Ānanda, when the night had passed, when the middle watch of the night had gone, after rising from his seat, arranging his robe on one shoulder, and raising his hands in respectful salutation, said this to the Gracious One: "The night has passed, reverend Sir, the middle watch of the night has gone, for a long time the Community of monks has been sitting, may the Gracious One recite the Pāṭimokkha for the monks."</p>

<p>For a second time the Gracious One was silent.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>For a third time venerable Ānanda, when the night had passed, when the last watch of the night had gone, when dawn had risen, when the night had a joyful appearance, after rising from his seat, arranging his robe on one shoulder, and raising his hands in respectful salutation, said this to the Gracious One: "The night has passed, reverend Sir, the last watch of the night has gone, dawn has risen, the night has a joyful appearance, for a long time the Community of monks has been sitting, may the Gracious One recite the Pāṭimokkha for the monks."</p>

<p>"The assembly is not completely pure, Ānanda."</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Then it occurred to venerable Mahāmoggallāna: "With regard to which person did the Gracious One say this: ‘The assembly is not completely pure, Ānanda’? " Then venerable Mahāmoggallāna applied his mind and encompassed fully the whole of that Community of monks with his mind. Venerable Mahāmoggallāna saw that person who was lacking in virtue, of bad character, of impure and doubtful conduct, who covered up his deeds, who was not an ascetic, though making it known he was an ascetic, who was not living the spiritual life, though making it known he was living the spiritual life, who was filthy inside, polluted, and gone rotten, sat in the middle of the Community of monks.</p>

<p>Having seen <span class="add">him</span>, after rising from his seat he went to that person, and after going, he said this to that person: "Get up, friend, you have been seen by the Gracious One, there is no longer communion for you with the monks."</p>

<p>Then that person was silent.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>For a second time venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this to that person: "Get up, friend, you have been seen by the Gracious One, there is no longer communion for you with the monks."</p>

<p>For a second time that person was silent.</p>

<p>For a third time venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this to that person: "Get up, friend, you have been seen by the Gracious One, there is no longer communion for you with the monks."</p>

<p>For a third time that person was silent.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Then venerable Mahāmoggallāna, having taken that person by the arm, having expelled him outside the doorway, and drawn the lock, went to the Gracious One, and after going, he said this to the Gracious One: "I have expelled that person, reverend Sir, the assembly is <span class="add">now</span> completely pure, may the Gracious One, venerable Sir, recite the Pāṭimokkha for the monks."</p>

<p>"It is wonderful, Moggallāna, it is marvellous, Moggallāna, how that foolish person waited until he was grabbed by the arm."</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>Then the Gracious One addressed the monks: "From now onwards, monks, I will not hold the Observance, or recite the Pāṭimokkha. From now onwards, monks, you must hold the Observance, and recite the Pāṭimokkha. This is impossible, monks, it is not permitted, that the Realised One should hold the Observance in an assembly that is not completely pure, and should recite the Pāṭimokkha.</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"There are these eight wonderful and marvellous things about the great ocean, monks, which, having seen and considered, the Asuras delight in the great ocean. Which eight?</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"The great ocean, monks, gradually inclines, gradually slopes, gradually slants, certainly does not have an abrupt falling away. That the great ocean, monks, gradually inclines, gradually slopes, gradually slants, certainly does not have an abrupt falling away, monks, is the first wonderful and marvellous thing about the great ocean, which, having seen and considered, the Asuras delight in the great ocean.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"Furthermore, monks, the great ocean is a steady thing, which doesn’t transgress the shoreline.

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"Furthermore, monks, the great ocean does not endure a dead corpse, and when there is a dead corpse in the great ocean it quickly carries it to the bank, throws it up on dry ground.

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"Furthermore, monks, the streams in the world flow into the great ocean, and showers fall from the sky, but it is not known that there is a depletion or filling of the great ocean by that. That, monks, the streams in the world flow into the great ocean, and showers fall from the sky, but it is not known that there is a depletion or filling of the great ocean by that, monks, is the fifth wonderful and marvellous thing about the great ocean, which, having seen and considered, the Asuras delight in the great ocean.</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"Furthermore, monks, the great ocean has one taste, the taste of salt. That, monks, the great ocean has one taste, the taste of salt, monks, is the sixth wonderful and marvellous thing about the great ocean, which, having seen and considered, the Asuras delight in the great ocean.</p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"Furthermore, monks, the great ocean has many precious things, countless precious things, and therein are these precious things, that is to say: pearls, crystals, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, quartz, coral, silver, gold, ruby, and cat's eyes. That, monks, the great ocean has many precious things, countless precious things, and therein are these precious things, that is to say: pearls, crystals, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, quartz, coral, silver, gold, ruby, and cat's eyes, monks, is the seventh wonderful and marvellous thing about the great ocean, which, having seen and considered, the Asuras delight in the great ocean.</p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>"Furthermore, monks, the great ocean is a dwelling place for great beings, and therein are these beings: Timis, Timingalas, Timirapiṅgalas, Asuras, Nāgas, Gandhabbas, and there are in the great ocean individuals of a hundred leagues, and individuals of two hundred leagues, and individuals of three hundred leagues, and individuals of four hundred leagues, and individuals of five hundred leagues.

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>"In the same way, monks, there are eight wonderful and marvellous things about this Dhamma and Discipline, which, having seen and considered, the monks delight in this Dhamma and Discipline. Which eight?</p>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>"Just as the great ocean, monks, gradually inclines, gradually slopes, gradually slants, certainly does not fall away abruptly, so, monks, in this Dhamma and Discipline there is a gradual training, a gradual performance, a gradual practice, it certainly does not have an abrupt penetration of knowledge.

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>"Just as, monks, the great ocean is a steady thing, which doesn’t transgress the shoreline, so, monks, those training rules which are laid down by me for my disciples, my disciples do not transgress even for the sake of life.

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>"Just as, monks, the streams in the world flow into the great ocean, and showers fall from the sky, but it is not known that there is a depletion or filling of the great ocean by that, so, monks, even if many monks, are completely emancipated in the Emancipation-element which has no basis for attachment remaining, it is not known that the Emancipation-element is either depleted or filled by that.
