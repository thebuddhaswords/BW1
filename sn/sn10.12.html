<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Aḷavi, the haunt of the yakkha Āḷavaka.<span class="note" id="n593"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.593] This sutta, also found at <a href="sn1.10.html">Sn I, 10</a> (pp. 31–33), is included in the Sri Lankan <i>Maha Pirit Pota.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> relates the long background story, of which I sketch only the highlights:

<br class="half">One day King Āḷavaka of Āḷavī, while on a hunt, was captured by the ferocious yakkha Āḷavaka, who threatened to eat him. The king could obtain release only by promising the demon that he would provide him daily with a human victim. First the king sent the criminals from the prison, but when there were no more prisoners he required every family to provide a child. All the families with children eventually fled to other lands and it became incumbent on the king to offer his own son, the Āḷavaka prince. The Buddha, aware of the impending sacrifice, went to the yakkha's haunt on the day before the offering was to take place in order to convert the demon from his evil ways. At that time the yakkha was attending a meeting in the Himalayas, but the Buddha entered his cave, sat down on the yakkha's throne, and preached the Dhamma to his harem ladies. When the yakkha heard about this, he hastened back to Āḷavı in a fury and demanded that the Blessed One leave.</span></span></span> Then the yakkha Āḷavaka approached the Blessed One and said to him: "Get out, ascetic!"</p>

<p>"All right, friend," the Blessed One said, and he went out.<span class="note" id="n594"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.594] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: The Buddha complied with the yakkha's demands three times because he knew that compliance was the most effective way to soften his mind. But when the yakkha thought to send the Buddha in and out all night long, the Master refused to obey.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Come in, ascetic."</p>

<p>"All right, friend," the Blessed One said, and he went in.</p>

<hr>
<p>A second time … <a class="pts_pn">sn.i.214</a> A third time the yakkha Āḷavaka said to the Blessed One: "Get out, ascetic!"</p>

<p>"All right, friend," the Blessed One said, and he went out.</p>

<p>"Come in, ascetic."</p>

<p>"All right, friend," the Blessed One said, and he went in.</p>

<hr>
<p>A fourth time the yakkha Āḷavaka said to the Blessed One: "Get out, ascetic."</p>

<p>"I won’t go out, friend. Do whatever you have to do."</p>

<p>"I’ll ask you a question, ascetic. If you won’t answer me, I’ll drive you insane or I’ll split your heart or I’ll grab you by the feet and hurl you across the Ganges."<span class="note" id="n595"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.595] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: It is said that when he was a child his parents had taught him eight questions and answers which they had learnt from the Buddha Kassapa. As time passed he forgot the answers, but he had preserved the questions written in vermillion on a golden scroll, which he kept in his cave.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"I do not see anyone in this world, friend, with its devas, Māra, and Brahma, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, who could drive me insane or split my heart or grab me by the feet and hurl me across the Ganges. But ask whatever you want, friend."<span class="note" id="n596"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.596] <i>Api ca tvaṁ āvuso puccha yad ākaṅkhasi.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: With these words the Buddha extended to him the invitation of an Omniscient One <i>(sabbaññupavāraṇaṁ pavāresi)</i>, which cannot be extended by any paccekabuddhas, chief disciples, or great disciples.</span></span></span></p>

This brings human happiness, celestial happiness, and in the end the happiness of Nibbāna. By truth here truthful speech is intended, with Nibbāna as the ultimate truth <i>(paramatthasacca)</i> and truth as abstinence (from falsehood; <i>viratisacca</i>) comprised within that. Of the various kinds of tastes, truth is really the sweetest of tastes, truth alone is the sweetest <i>(sadutaraṁ)</i>. Or it is the best <i>(sadhutaraṁ)</i>, the supreme, the highest. For such tastes as that of roots, etc., nourish only the body and bring a defiled happiness, but the taste of truth nourishes the mind with serenity and insight and brings an undefiled happiness.

<br class="half">One living by wisdom <i>(paññajiviṁ jīvitaṁ)</i>: A householder lives by wisdom when he works at an honourable occupation, goes for refuge, gives alms, observes the precepts, and fulfils the Uposatha duties, etc. One gone forth as a monk lives by wisdom when he undertakes pure virtue and the superior practices beginning with purification of mind.</span></span></span></p>

Since the faith faculty is the basis for the four factors of stream-entry (see <a href="sn55.1.html">SN55.1</a>), the first line shows the stream-enterer, who has crossed the flood of views; the second line shows the once-returner, who by means of diligence has crossed the flood of existence except for one more existence in the sense-sphere world; the third line shows the nonreturner, who has overcome the flood of sensuality, a mass of suffering; and the fourth line shows the path of arahantship, which includes the fully purified wisdom by means of which one crosses over the flood of ignorance.

<br>For the attainment of Nibbāna,
<br>From desire to learn one gains wisdom
<br>If one is diligent and astute.<span class="note" id="n600"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.600] in pāda c, I read <i>sussūsā</i> with Se and Ee1 &amp; 2. Be reads <i>sussūsaṁ</i> as does the lemma of <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> (Be), while the corresponding lemma in Spk (Se) has <i>sussūsā</i>. From the paraphrase (see below) <i>sussūsā</i> can be understood as a truncated instrumental <i>(= sussūsāya)</i>. In Be, <i>sussūsaṁ</i> seems to function as an accusative in apposition to <i>paññaṁ,</i> perhaps as the first member of a split compound, i.e., "the wisdom (consisting in) the desire to learn."

<br class="half">Spk: The Blessed One shows here four causes for the gaining of wisdom. First one places faith in the Dhamma by which the arahants—Buddhas, paccekabuddhas, and disciples—attained Nibbāna. By so doing one gains the mundane and supramundane wisdom for the attainment of Nibbāna. But that does not come to pass merely by faith. When faith is born one approaches a teacher, lends an ear, and hears the Dhamma; thus one gains a desire to learn <i>(sussūsaṁ)</i>. When one lends an ear and listens from a desire to learn, one gains wisdom. But one must also be diligent <i>(appamatto)</i>, in the sense of being constantly mindful, and astute <i>(vicakkhaṇa)</i>, able to distinguish what is well spoken and badly spoken. Through faith one enters upon the practice that leads to gaining wisdom. Through a desire to learn <i>(sussūsāya)</i> one carefully listens to the means for acquiring wisdom; through diligence <i>(appamādena)</i> one does not forget what one has learnt; through astuteness <i>(vicakkhaṇatāya)</i> one expands upon what one has learnt. Or else: through a desire to learn one lends an ear and listens to the Dhamma by which one gains wisdom; through diligence one bears in mind the Dhamma heard; by astuteness one examines the meaning and then gradually one realizes the ultimate truth.</span></span></span></p>

The difficulty arises not only on account of the replacement of <i>dhiti</i> by <i>khantyā</i> in the second verse but also because of the variant readings of the second term. Perhaps the best reading is that in Se, which accords with Sn (Ee) vv. <a href="../snp/snp1.10.html#p187">187–88</a>: in v.&nbsp;853, <i>saccaṁ dhammo dhiti cāgo;</i> in v.&nbsp;854, <i>saccā damā cāga khantyā.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> (Be) and Spk (Se) differ over the second term: the former has <i>dammo</i> and <i>dammā,</i> the latter <i>dhammo</i> and <i>dhammā.</i> The explanations in Spk-pṭ establish beyond doubt that <i>dhammo</i> and dama were the respective readings known to Dhammapala.

<br class="half">The four qualities mentioned at vv.&nbsp;853–54 refer back to vv.&nbsp;851–52. Truth corresponds to truthfulness in v.&nbsp;852c (<i>sacca</i> in all three instances), while generosity <i>(caga)</i> clearly corresponds to giving <i>(dadaṁ)</i> in v.&nbsp;852d. Spk (Se) explains that Dhamma is spoken of (in v. <a href="sn10.12.html#v851">851c</a>) under the name of wisdom gained through a desire to learn, on which Spk-pṭ comments: "Wisdom is called Dhamma because of bearing up and examining <i>(dhāraṇato upadhāraṇato)</i> entities in accordance with actuality." (As the verb <i>dhāreti</i> (&gt; <i>dhāraṇa</i>) is the stock etymological explanation of <i>dhamma</i> in the commentaries, we can infer that the author of Spk-pṭ had a text that read <i>dhammo</i>.) Steadfastness <i>(dhiti)</i> is spoken of under the names dutifulness and initiative (in v.&nbsp;852ab).</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">In its paraphrase of v.&nbsp;854, Spk states: "Come now, ask the many ascetics and brahmins whether there is any greater means for winning acclaim than truthfulness; any greater means for gaining mundane and supramundane wisdom than self-control (I suggest reading <i>damā,</i> following Spk-pṭ, which explains that wisdom is so designated because it controls <i>[dameti]</i> the defilements as well as body and speech, etc.); any greater means of binding friends than generosity; and any greater means for finding mundane and supramundane wealth than patience, which is identical with activated energy, (called patience) in the sense that it endures heavy burdens, and which is referred to by the names dutifulness and initiative."</span>

They handed the infant to the yakkha, who presented him to the Buddha. The Master recited some verses of blessing over the boy and returned him to the king's men. When the prince reached maturity, he was known as Hatthaka Āḷavaka, because he had been passed around from one person's hands <i>(hattha)</i> to another's. He attained the stage of nonreturner and was one of the Buddha’s foremost lay disciples, the chief of those who win followings through the four bases of beneficence (<i>saṅgahavatthu;</i> see <a href="../an/an1.258-267.html">AN I 26,7–9</a>). The Buddha holds him up as a model for male lay followers at <a href="sn17.23.html">SN17.23</a> and praises his virtues at <a href="../an/an8.23.html">AN IV 217–20</a>.</span></span></span></p>
