<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Then Rasiya the headman approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: "Venerable sir, I have heard: ‘The ascetic Gotama criticizes all austerity. He categorically blames and reviles any ascetic who leads a rough life.’ Do those who speak thus, venerable sir, state what has been said by the Blessed One and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact? Do they explain in accordance with the Dhamma so that no reasonable consequence of their assertion would be open to criticism?"</p>

<p>"Those who speak thus, headman, do not state what has been said by me but misrepresent me with untruth and falsehood.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"There are, headman, these two extremes which should not be cultivated by one who has gone forth into homelessness: the pursuit of sensual happiness in sensual pleasures, which is low, vulgar, the way of worldlings, ignoble, unbeneficial; and the pursuit of self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, unbeneficial. Without veering towards either of these extremes, the Tathāgata has awakened to the middle way, <a class="pts_pn">sn.iv.331</a> which gives rise to vision, which gives rise to knowledge, which leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna. And what is that middle way awakened to by the Tathāgata, which gives rise to vision … leads to Nibbāna? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view … right concentration. This is that middle way awakened to by the Tathāgata, which gives rise to vision, which gives rise to knowledge, which leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.<span class="note" id="n354"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.354] These are the words with which the Buddha opened his first sermon; see <a href="sn56.11.html">SN56.11</a>. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: The pursuit of sensual happiness is mentioned to show the types who enjoy sensual pleasure (ii –iii); the pursuit of self-mortification to show the ascetics (iv–v); the middle way to show the three types of wearing away (vi). What is the purpose in showing all this? The Tathāgata, who attained perfect enlightenment by abandoning the two extremes and by following the middle way, does not criticize or praise all enjoyers of sensual pleasures or all ascetics. He criticizes those who deserve criticism and praises those who deserve praise.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"There are, headman, these three persons who enjoy sensual pleasures existing in the world.

Those who rank positive on all three counts will be further divided into those who remain attached to their wealth and those who are unattached to it.

Nijjarā,</i> "wearing away," was a Jain term adopted by the Buddha. The Jains held that ascetic practice was the means to "wear away" all suffering <i>(sabbaṁ dukkhaṁ nijjiṇṇaṁ bhavissati)</i>; see their position at <a href="../mn/mn14.html">MN&nbsp;I 93,2–11</a> and <a href="../mn/mn101.html">II 214,7–13</a>, and the Buddha’s alternative approach to "wearing away" at <a href="../mn/mn101.html">MN&nbsp;II 223–25</a>. Three other kinds of <i>sandiṭṭhikā nijjarā</i> are described at <a href="../an/an3.74.html">AN I 221,5–30</a> (i.e., virtue, the jhānas, the destruction of the taints) and a twentyfold <i>nijjara</i> is at <a href="../mn/mn117.html">MN&nbsp;III 76,12–77,23</a>. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> says that one path is described as three kinds of wearing away because of the wearing away of the three defilements.</span></span></span> immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise. What three?</p>

<p>"Someone is lustful, and on account of lust he intends for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, for the affliction of both. When lust is abandoned, he does not intend for his own affliction, or for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both. The wearing away is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.</p>

<p>"Someone is full of hatred, and on account of hatred he intends for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, for the affliction of both. When hatred is abandoned, he does not intend for his own affliction, or for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both. <a class="pts_pn">sn.iv.340</a> The wearing away is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.</p>

<p>"Someone is deluded, and on account of delusion he intends for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, for the affliction of both. When delusion is abandoned, he does not intend for his own affliction, or for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both. The wearing away is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.</p>

<p>"These, headman, are the three kinds of wearing away that are directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise."</p>
