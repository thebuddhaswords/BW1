<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard.<span class="note" id="n137"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.137] This incident is recorded in the Mahaparinibbāna Sutta, at <a href="../dn/dn16.html">DN II 98–101</a>. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> assigns the incident to the tenth month before the Master's demise.</span></span></span> On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in Beluvagāmaka. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

<p>"Come, bhikkhus, enter upon the rains wherever you have friends, acquaintances, and intimates in the vicinity of Vesālī. I myself will enter upon the rains right here in Beluvagāmaka."</p>

<p>"Yes, venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied, and they entered upon the rains wherever they had friends, acquaintances, and intimates in the vicinity of Vesālī, while the Blessed One entered upon the rains right there in Beluvagāmaka.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then, when the Blessed One had entered upon the rains, a severe illness arose in him and terrible pains bordering on death assailed him. But the Blessed One endured them, mindful and clearly comprehending, without becoming distressed. Then the thought occurred to the Blessed One: "It is not proper for me to attain final Nibbāna without having addressed my attendants and taken leave of the Bhikkhu Saṅgha. Let me then suppress this illness by means of energy and live on, having resolved upon the life formation."<span class="note" id="n138"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.138] <i>Jīvitasaṅkhāraṃ adhiṭṭhāya.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: The life formation is life itself (Spk-pṭ: because of revitalizing the body without letting it fail) as well as fruition attainment, by which life is vitalized, sustained, prolonged. The latter is intended here. The concise meaning is, "I will attain fruition attainment, which is capable of prolonging life." He entered the attainment with the determination, "Let the pain not arise for another ten months," and the pain, suppressed by the attainment, did not arise for another ten months.</span></span></span> <a class="pts_pn">sn.v.153</a> Then the Blessed One suppressed that illness by means of energy and lived on, having resolved upon the life formation.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>The Blessed One then recovered from that illness. Soon after he had recovered, he came out from his dwelling and sat down in the seat that had been prepared in the shade behind the dwelling. The Venerable Ānanda then approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: "It's splendid, venerable sir, that the Blessed One is bearing up, splendid that he has recovered!<span class="note" id="n139"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.139] I follow Se and Ee, which do not include the initial exclamation found in Be, <i>diṭṭho me bhante bhagavato phāsu;</i> the latter, however, is at <a href="../dn/dn16.html">DN II 99,21</a>. I think Ee is correct in retaining <i>diṭṭha;</i> in Se and Be the word is taken as a past participle and is represented as neuter <i>diṭṭhaṁ,</i> but here it seems to function idiomatically with the meaning "lucky" or "splendid." See <a href="../dn/dn26.html">DN III 73,18</a>: <i>diṭṭhā bho satta jīvasi,</i> "It's splendid, sir being, that you’re alive." The lines that follow are at <a href="sn22.84.html">SN22:84</a> (III 106,19–21); see III, n. <a href="sn22.149.html">SN22:149</a>. Here <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> explains <i>dhamma pi nappaṭibhanti</i> as meaning, "The teachings on the establishments of mindfulness <i>(satipaṭṭhānadhammā)</i> are not clear to me." Possibly the expression means simply, "Things (in general) aren’t clear to me."</span></span></span> But, venerable sir, when the Blessed One was ill my body seemed as if it were drugged, I had become disoriented, the teachings were not clear to me. Nevertheless, I had this much consolation: that the Blessed One would not attain final Nibbāna without having made some pronouncement concerning the Bhikkhu Saṅgha."</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"What does the Bhikkhu Saṅgha now expect from me, Ānanda? I have taught the Dhamma, Ānanda, without making a distinction between inside and outside.<span class="note" id="n140"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.140] <i>Anantaraṁ abāhiraṁ.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: Without making a distinction of inside and outside with respect either to Dhamma or persons. One makes the distinction with respect to Dhamma when one thinks, "I will teach so much Dhamma to others but this much I won’t teach." One does so with respect to persons when one thinks, "I’ll teach this person but not that one." The Master did not teach in this way. The "teacher's closed fist" <i>(ācariyamuṭṭhi)</i> is found among outsiders, who reserve certain teachings for their favourite pupils only when they are lying on their deathbed; but the Tathāgata does not have this.

<br class="half">In connection with these two ideas, see Mil 144–45, 159–60.</span></span></span> The Tathāgata has no closed fist of a teacher in regard to the teachings. If, Ānanda, anyone thinks, ‘I will take charge of the Bhikkhu Saṅgha,’ or ‘The Bhikkhu Saṅgha is under my direction,’ it is he who should make some pronouncement concerning the Bhikkhu Saṅgha. But, Ānanda, it does not occur to the Tathāgata, ‘I will take charge of the Bhikkhu Saṅgha,’ or ‘The Bhikkhu Saṅgha is under my direction, ’ so why should the Tathāgata make some pronouncement concerning the Bhikkhu Saṅgha? Now I am old, Ānanda, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage. My age is now turning eighty. Just as an old cart keeps going by a combination of straps,<span class="note" id="n141"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.141] Readings of this obscure compound vary. Be has <i>vekhamissakena,</i> Se <i>veghamissakena</i> (the reading at Ee <a href="../dn/dn16.html">DN II 100,14–15</a>), Ee <i>vedhamissakena.</i> In a note Be proposes <i>veṭhamissakena,</i> the actual reading in the gloss given by Spk (both Be and Se). A similar expression occurs at <a href="../tha/tha2.html#p143">Th&nbsp;143a</a>, in Ee <i>veghamissena.</i> At EV I, n. to 143, Norman presents the case for <i>veṭha</i> (= Skt <i>veṣṭa,</i> "band, noose"). Gombrich discusses the problem in "Old Bodies Like Carts," arguing for the reading <i>vedha,</i> "trembling," but it is hard to see how this sits comfortably in a compound with <i>missakena.</i> Hence I follow Spk and Norman in reading <i>veṭhamissakena.</i>

<br class="half">Spk: By a combination of straps: by a combination of straps through being repaired with bands for the arms, bands for the wheels, etc. <i>(bāhābandhacakkabandhādinā paṭisaṅkharaṇena veṭhamissakena)</i>. So it seems … keeps going <i>(maññe yāpeti)</i>: He shows, "Like an old cart, it seems it is by a combination of straps, i.e., by being strapped with the fruition of arahantship <i>(arahattaphalaveṭhanena)</i>, that the body of the Tathāgata assumes the four modes of deportment."</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">It should be noted that this passage would hardly make sense if the commentaries were right in holding that Ānanda was born on the same day as the Bodhisatta, for the Buddha would not need to insist on the frailties of old age if Ānanda too was an old man. See II, n. <a href="sn16.11.html#n296">296</a>.</span></span></span> so it seems the body of the Tathāgata keeps going by a combination of straps. <a class="pts_pn">sn.v.154</a></p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"Whenever, Ānanda, by nonattention to all signs and by the cessation of certain feelings, the Tathāgata enters and dwells in the signless concentration of mind, on that occasion, Ānanda, the body of the Tathāgata is more comfortable.<span class="note" id="n142"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.142] The expression used here is <i>animitta cetosamādhi,</i> but this concentration must be different from the one with the same name mentioned at <a href="sn40.9.html">SN40.9</a>. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> explains the latter as deep insight concentration, the present one as fruition attainment <i>(phalasamāpatti)</i>. This would then make it identical with the <i>animitta cetovimutti</i> of <a href="sn41.7.html">SN41.7</a> (IV 297,4–6).</span></span></span> Therefore, Ānanda, dwell with yourselves as your own island, with yourselves as your own refuge, with no other refuge; dwell with the Dhamma as your island, with the Dhamma as your refuge, with no other refuge.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>And how, Ānanda, does a bhikkhu dwell with himself as his own island, with himself as his own refuge, with no other refuge; with the Dhamma as his island, with the Dhamma as his refuge, with no other refuge? Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world.</p>

<p>"Those bhikkhus, Ānanda, either now or after I am gone, who dwell with themselves as their own island, with themselves as their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the Dhamma as their island, with the Dhamma as their refuge, with no other refuge—it is these bhikkhus, Ānanda, who will be for me topmost of those keen on the training."<span class="note" id="n143"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.143] The <i>attadīpa</i> exhortation is also at <a href="sn22.43.html">SN22.43</a>. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> explains <i>dhamma</i> in <i>dhammadīpa, dhammasaraṇa</i> as the ninefold supramundane Dhamma (the four paths, four fruits, and Nibbāna). <i>Tamatagge</i> has been much puzzled over in the scholarly literature on the Mahaparinibbāna Sutta. Spk (which parallels Sv II 548–49) takes the term as equivalent to <i>tama-agge,</i> with <i>-t-</i> inserted as a euphonic conjunct <i>(padasandhi)</i>. It is possible that <i>tamatagge</i> should be understood as equivalent to <i>tamato agge,</i> on the analogy of<i> ajjatagge</i> or <i>daharatagge,</i> but this would still leave the problem of meaning unsolved; "from the darkness on" hardly makes good sense here. Spk is evidently perplexed about the meaning and, without quite admitting uncertainty, wavers between taking <i>tama</i> as the superlative suffix (transposed by metathesis) and as "darkness": "These are topmost <i>(aggatamā)</i>, hence tamatagga. Thus, ‘having cut the entire stream of darkness (<i>tamasotaṁ</i> in both Be and Se, but <i>tamayogaṁ,</i> bond of darkness, in the parallel passage at Sv II 549,1), these bhikkhus of mine will be at the extreme top, in the highest place. They will be at the top of them. Among all those keen on the training, just those whose range is the four <i>satipaṭṭhānas</i> will be at the top.’ Thus he brings the teaching to its culmination in arahantship." Spkpṭ explains tama-agge: "In the absence of the bond of darkness <i>(tamayoga!)</i>, (they will be) at the top of the world with its gods."

<br class="half">The words are not preserved in the fragments of the Turfan Skt version, but the Tibetan and Chinese parallels, probably based on Skt texts, point to a meaning as "the highest." I have followed suit with "topmost," though I cannot account for the exact meaning of the original or for the use of the locative. I have also gone along with the commentaries in taking <i>ye keci sikkhākāmā</i> as an implicit genitive.</span></span></span></p>
