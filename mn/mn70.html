<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Kāsi country together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, I abstain from eating at night. By so doing, I am free from illness and affliction, and I enjoy lightness, strength, and a comfortable abiding. <span class="note" id="n"><span class="details"><span class="p">From this passage, it appears that the Buddha restricted the allowable time for bhikkhus’ meals in two successive stages, first prohibiting only the afternoon meal and allowing a night meal. However, in the Vinaya account of the origin of <a href="../vi/bu-vb-pc37.html">Pācittiya 37</a> no mention is made of this successive prohibition. To the contrary, the text seems to assume it to be an item of common knowledge that monks should not consume food past noon, and it shows the Buddha laying down the rule against untimely eating with one categorical pronouncement valid for all meals past noon.</span></span></span>Come, bhikkhus, abstain from eating at night. By so doing, you too will be free from illness and affliction, and you will enjoy lightness, strength, and a comfortable abiding."<span class="note" id="n696"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.696] See note <a href="mn66.html#n671">671</a>.  In agreement with <a href="../mn/mn66.html">MN&nbsp;66</a>, <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains that the Buddha had first prohibited the afternoon meal and then at a later time prohibited the night meal. He did this out of concern for the delicate bhikkhus in the Order, since they might have become fatigued too quickly if both late meals were prohibited simultaneously.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p>"Yes, venerable sir," they replied.</p>

<p>Then, as the Blessed One was wandering by stages in the Kāsi country, he eventually arrived at a Kāsi town called Kīṭāgiri. There he lived in this Kāsi town, Kīṭāgiri.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Now on that occasion the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka were residing at Kīṭāgiri.<span class="note" id="n697"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.697] In the Vinaya Piṭaka, the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka are described as "unscrupulous and depraved" monks and are shown indulging in various kinds of bad conduct that corrupt the laity. At Kiṭāgiri an act of banishment was pronounced against them, and their refusal to obey led to the promulgation of <a href="../vi/bu-vb-sn13.html">Saṅghādisesa&nbsp;13</a> (Vin iii.179–84).</span></span></span> Then a number of bhikkhus went and told them: "Friends, the Blessed One and the Saṅgha of bhikkhus now abstain from eating at night. By so doing, they are free from illness and affliction, and they enjoy health, strength, and a comfortable abiding. Come, friends, abstain from eating at night. By so doing, you too will be free from illness and affliction, and you will enjoy lightness, strength, and a comfortable abiding." When this was said, the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka told those bhikkhus: "Friends, we eat in the evening, in the morning, and in the day outside the proper time. By so doing, we are free from illness and affliction, and we enjoy lightness, strength, and a comfortable abiding. Why should we abandon <span class="add">a benefit</span> visible here and now to pursue <span class="add">a benefit to be achieved</span> at a future time? We shall eat in the evening, in the morning, and in the day outside the proper time."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Since the bhikkhus were unable to convince the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka, they went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and told him all that had occurred, adding: "Venerable sir, since we were unable to convince the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka, we have reported this matter to the Blessed One."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus: "Come, bhikkhu, tell the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka in my name that the Teacher calls them."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Yes, venerable sir," he replied, and he went to the bhikkhus led by Assaji and Punabbasuka and told them: "The Teacher calls you, friends."</p>

<p>"Yes, friend," they replied, and they went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, sat down at one side. The Blessed One then said: "Bhikkhus, is it true that when a number of bhikkhus went and told you: ‘Friends, the Blessed One and the Saṅgha now abstain from eating at night … Come, friends, abstain from eating at night …,’ you told those bhikkhus: ‘Friends, we eat in the evening … Why should we abandon <span class="add">a benefit</span> visible here and now to pursue <span class="add">a benefit to be achieved</span> at a future time? We shall eat in the evening, in the morning, and in the day outside the proper time’?" — "Yes, venerable sir."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"Bhikkhus, have you known me to teach the Dhamma in such a way as this: ‘Whatever this person experiences, whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase’?"<span class="note" id="n698"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.698] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>: This statement is made with pointed reference to pleasure experienced in eating a night meal, which does not conduce to the practice of a monk's duties.</span></span></span> — "No, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, have you not known me to teach the Dhamma in such a way as this: ‘Here, when someone feels a certain kind of pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish; but when someone feels another kind of pleasant feeling, unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase.<span class="note" id="n699"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.699] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>: The former type of pleasant feeling is the joy based on the household life, the latter the joy based on renunciation. Similarly, the next two sentences refer to the grief and equanimity based, respectively, on the household life and on renunciation. See <b><a href="../mn/mn137.html#8">MN137</a></b>.</span></span></span> Here, when someone feels a certain kind of painful feeling, unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish; but when someone feels another kind of painful feeling, unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase. Here, when someone feels a certain kind of neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish; but when someone feels another kind of neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase’?" — "Yes, venerable sir."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"Good, bhikkhus.<span class="note" id="n700"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.700] ¶¶4–15 serve to provide, by appeal to the Buddha’s perfect understanding, the grounds for his injunction to abandon all feelings based on the household life and to develop the feelings based on renunciation.</span></span></span> And if it were unknown by me, unseen, unfound, unrealised, uncontacted by wisdom thus: ‘Here, when someone feels a certain kind of pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish,’ would it be fitting for me, not knowing that, to say: ‘Abandon such a kind of pleasant feeling’?" — "No, venerable sir."</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"But because it is known by me, seen, found, realised, contacted by wisdom thus: ‘Here, when someone feels a certain kind of pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish,’ that I therefore say: ‘Abandon such a kind of pleasant feeling.’</p>

<hr>
<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"If it were unknown by me, unseen, unfound, unrealised, uncontacted by wisdom thus: ‘Here, when someone feels another kind of pleasant feeling, unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase,’ would it be fitting for me, not knowing that, to say: ‘Enter upon and abide in such a kind of pleasant feeling’?" — "No, venerable sir."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"But because it is known by me, seen, found, realised, contacted by wisdom thus: ‘Here, when someone feels another kind of pleasant feeling, unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase,’ that I therefore say: ‘Enter upon and abide in such a kind of pleasant feeling.’</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"If it were unknown by me … But because it is known by me … contacted by wisdom thus: ‘Here, when someone feels a certain kind of painful feeling, unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish,’ that I therefore say: ‘Abandon such a kind of painful feeling.’</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"If it were unknown by me … But because it is known by me … contacted by wisdom thus: ‘Here, when someone feels another kind of painful feeling, unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase,’ that I therefore say: ‘Enter upon and abide in such a kind of painful feeling.’</p>

<hr>
<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"If it were unknown by me … But because it is known by me … contacted by wisdom thus: ‘Here, when someone feels a certain kind of neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish,’ that I therefore say: ‘Abandon such a kind of neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.’</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"If it were unknown by me … But because it is known by me … contacted by wisdom thus: ‘Here, when someone feels another kind of neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase,’ that I therefore say: ‘Enter upon and abide in such a kind of neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.’</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"Bhikkhus, I do not say of all bhikkhus that they still have work to do with diligence; nor do I say of all bhikkhus that they have no more work to do with diligence.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"I do not say of those bhikkhus who are arahants with taints destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and are completely liberated through final knowledge, that they still have work to do with diligence. Why is that? They have done their work with diligence; they are no more capable of being negligent.</p>

<p>"I say of such bhikkhus who are in higher training, whose minds have not yet reached the goal, and who are still aspiring to the supreme security from bondage, that they still have work to do with diligence. Why is that? Because when those venerable ones make use of suitable resting places and associate with good friends and nurture their spiritual faculties, they may by realising for themselves with direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness. Seeing this fruit of diligence for these bhikkhus, I say that they still have work to do with diligence.</p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"Bhikkhus, there are seven kinds of persons to be found existing in the world.<span class="note" id="n701"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.701] Here follows a sevenfold classification of noble individuals which categorises them not merely on the basis of their path and fruit attainment — as the more familiar eightfold scheme does — but according to their dominant faculty. Alternative definitions of these seven are offered by Pug 1:30–36/14–15.</span></span></span> What seven? They are: one liberated-in-both ways, one liberated-by-wisdom, a body-witness, one attained-to-view, one liberated-by-faith, a Dhamma-follower, and a faith-follower.</p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>"What kind of person is one liberated-in-both-ways? Here some person contacts with the body and abides in those liberations that are peaceful and immaterial, transcending forms, and his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom. This kind of person is called one liberated-in-both-ways.<span class="note" id="n702"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.702] <i>Ubhatobhāgavimutta.</i> <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> He is "liberated-in-both-ways" because he is liberated from the physical body by the immaterial attainments and from the mental body by the path (of arahantship). The Pug definition reads: "He contacts with the body and abides in the eight liberations, and his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom." MA says that the <i>ubhatobhāgavimutta</i> includes those who attain arahantship after emerging from one or another of the four immaterial attainments and the one who attains it after emerging from the attainment of cessation.</span></span></span> I do not say of such a bhikkhu that he still has work to do with diligence. Why is that? He has done his work with diligence; he is no more capable of being negligent.</p>

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>"What kind of person is one liberated-by-wisdom? Here some person does not contact with the body and abide in those liberations that are peaceful and immaterial, transcending forms, but his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom.

Why is that? He has done his work with diligence; he is no more capable of being negligent.</p>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>"What kind of person is a body-witness? Here some person contacts with the body and abides in those liberations that are peaceful and immaterial, transcending forms, and some of his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom.

MṬ stresses that one or another of the immaterial attainments including cessation is needed to qualify as <i>kāyasakkhin.</i> The Pug definition merely substitutes the eight liberations.</span></span></span> I say of such a bhikkhu that he still has work to do with diligence. Why is that? Because when that venerable one makes use of suitable resting places and associates with good friends and nurtures his spiritual faculties, he may by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness.

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>"What kind of person is one attained-to-view? Here some person does not contact with the body and abide in those liberations that are peaceful and immaterial, transcending forms, but some of his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom, and he has reviewed and examined with wisdom the teachings proclaimed by the Tathāgata.

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>"What kind of person is a faith-follower? Here some person does not contact with the body and abide in those liberations that are peaceful and immaterial, transcending forms, and his taints are not yet destroyed by his seeing with wisdom, yet he has sufficient faith in and love for the Tathāgata. Furthermore, he has these qualities: the faith faculty, the energy faculty, the mindfulness faculty, the concentration faculty, and the wisdom faculty. This kind of person is called a faith-follower. I say of such a bhikkhu that he still has work to do with diligence. Why is that? Because when that venerable one makes use of suitable resting places and associates with good friends and nurtures his spiritual faculties, he may by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness. Seeing this fruit of diligence for such a bhikkhu, I say that he still has work to do with diligence.</p>

<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>"Bhikkhus, I do not say that final knowledge is achieved all at once. On the contrary, final knowledge is achieved by gradual training, by gradual practice, by gradual progress.</p>

<p>"And how is final knowledge achieved by gradual training, gradual practice, gradual progress? Here one who has faith <span class="add">in a teacher</span> visits him; when he visits him, he pays respect to him; when he pays respect to him, he gives ear; one who gives ear hears the Dhamma; having heard the Dhamma, he memorises it; he examines the meaning of the teachings he has memorised; when he examines their meaning, he gains a reflective acceptance of those teachings; when he has gained a reflective acceptance of those teachings, zeal springs up in him; when zeal has sprung up, he applies his will; having applied his will, he scrutinises; having scrutinised, he strives; resolutely striving, he realises with the body the supreme truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdom.<span class="note" id="n708"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.708] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>: With the mental body he realises Nibbāna, the ultimate truth, and he penetrates it with the wisdom pertaining to the supramundane path.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"There has not been that faith,<span class="note" id="n709"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.709] That is, these bhikkhus have not had the faith required to undertake the training laid down for them by the Buddha.</span></span></span> bhikkhus, and there has not been that visiting, and there has not been that paying of respect, and there has not been that giving ear, and there has not been that hearing of the Dhamma, and there has not been that memorising of the Dhamma, and there has not been that examination of the meaning, and there has not been that reflective acceptance of the teachings, and there has not been that zeal, and there has not been that application of will, and there has not been that scrutiny, and there has not been that striving. Bhikkhus, you have lost your way; bhikkhus, you have been practising the wrong way. Just how far, bhikkhus, have these misguided men strayed from this Doctrine and Discipline?</p>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>"Bhikkhus, there is a four-phrased statement, and when it is recited a wise man would quickly understand it.<span class="note" id="n710"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.710] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> says that the "four-phrased statement" <i>(catuppadaṁ veyyākaraṇaṁ)</i> is the teaching of the Four Noble Truths. However, no mention is made here of the four truths. Possibly, the four-phrased statement is the resolution on effort just below, with each clause counting as a phrase (the conditional clause being taken as two phrases).</span></span></span> I shall recite it to you, bhikkhus. Try to understand it."</p>

<p>"Venerable sir, who are we that we should understand the Dhamma?"</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, even with a teacher who is concerned with material things, an heir to material things, attached to material things, such haggling <span class="add">by his disciples</span> would not be proper: ‘If we get this, we will do it; if we don’t get this, we won’t do it’; so what <span class="add">should be said when the teacher is</span> the Tathāgata, who is utterly detached from material things?</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, for a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the Teacher's Dispensation, it is natural that he conduct himself thus: ‘The Blessed One is the Teacher, I am a disciple; the Blessed One knows, I do not know.’ For a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the Teacher's Dispensation, the Teacher's Dispensation is nourishing and refreshing. For a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the Teacher's Dispensation, it is natural that he conduct himself thus: ‘Willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up on my body, but my energy shall not be relaxed so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, manly energy, and manly persistence.’<span class="note" id="n711"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.711] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>: By this the Buddha shows that the ideal disciple practises by arousing his energy and resolving: "I shall not rise up so long as I have not attained arahantship."</span></span></span> For a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the Teacher's Dispensation, one of two fruits may be expected: either final knowledge here and now or, if there is a trace of clinging left, non-return."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>That is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
