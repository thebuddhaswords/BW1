<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard.<span class="note" id="n1"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1] For a fuller treatment of this important and difficult sutta, see Bhikkhu Bodhi, <i>Discourse on the Root of Existence.</i> This work contains, besides a translation of the sutta, a lengthy analytical study of its philosophical significance and copious extracts from the very helpful commentarial literature that has accumulated around it. <a href="mn0-abbr.html">Ñm's</a> rendering of this sutta in Ms was highly conjectural; thus, while I have retained most of his terminology, I have substituted my own rendering of the syntax to bring out the meaning that accords with the traditional interpretation and that seems warranted by the original Pali text as well. The key passages as Ñm rendered them will be given in the Notes.</span></span></span> On one occasion the Blessed One was living in Ukkaṭṭhā in the Subhaga Grove at the root of a royal sāla tree. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus."<span class="note" id="n2"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.2] <a href="../mn/mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains that the Buddha delivered this sutta to dispel the conceit that had arisen in five hundred bhikkhus on account of their erudition and intellectual mastery of the Buddha’s teachings. These bhikkhus were formerly brahmins learned in the Vedic literature, and the Buddha’s cryptic utterances may well have been intended to challenge the brahmanic views to which they may still have adhered.</span></span></span> — "Venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, I shall teach you a discourse on the root of all things.<span class="note" id="n3"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.3] <i>Sabbadhammamūlapariyāya.</i> <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MṬ</a> explains that the word "all" <i>(sabba)</i> is being used here in the restricted sense of the "all of personal identity" (<i>sakkāyasabba,</i>) that is, with reference to all states or phenomena <i>(dhammā)</i> comprised within the five aggregates affected by clinging (see <a href="../mn/mn28.html#3">MN&nbsp;28.3-4</a>). Supramundane states — the paths, fruits, and Nibbāna — are excluded. The "root of all things" — that is, the special condition that maintains the continuity of the process of repeated existence — <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MṬ</a> explains to be craving, conceit, and views (which are the underlying springs of "conceiving"), and these in turn are underlaid by ignorance, suggested in the sutta by the phrase "he has not fully understood it."</span></span></span> Listen and attend closely to what I shall say." — "Yes, venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<h3><span class="add">The Ordinary Person</span></h3>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Here, bhikkhus, an untaught ordinary person,<span class="note" id="n4"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.4] The "untaught ordinary person" <i>(assutavā puthujjana)</i> is the common worldling, who possesses neither learning nor spiritual accomplishment in the Dhamma of the noble ones, and allows himself to be dominated by the multitude of defilements and wrong views. See Bodhi, <i>Discourse on the Root of Existence,</i> pp. 40–46.</span></span></span> who has no regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, perceives earth as earth. <span class="note" id="n5"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.5] <i>Paṭhaviṁ paṭhavito sañjānāti.</i> Although perceiving "earth as earth" seems to suggest seeing the object as it really is, the aim of Buddhist insight meditation, the context makes it clear that the ordinary person's perception of "earth as earth" already introduces a slight distortion of the object, a distortion that will be blown up into full-fledged misinterpretation when the cognitive process enters the phase of "conceiving." MA explains that the ordinary person seizes upon the conventional expression "it is earth," and applying this to the object, perceives it through a "perversion of perception" <i>(saññāvipallāsa)</i>. The latter is a technical expression explained as perceiving the impermanent as permanent, the painful as pleasurable, what is not self as self, and what is foul as beautiful <i>(<a href="../an/an4.49,html">AN&nbsp;4:49</a>/ii.52)</i>. <a href="mn0-abbr.html">Ñm</a> reads the ablative suffix <i>-to</i> of the Pali as signifying derivation and translates the phrase: "From earth he has a percept of earth."</span></span></span> Having perceived earth as earth, he conceives <span class="add">himself as</span> earth, he conceives <span class="add">himself</span> in earth, he conceives <span class="add">himself apart</span> from earth, he conceives earth to be ‘mine,’ he delights in earth.<span class="note" id="n6"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.6] The Pali verb "conceives" <i>(maññati)</i>, from the root man, "to think," is often used in the Pali suttas to mean distortional thinking — thought that ascribes to its object characteristics and a significance derived not from the object itself, but from one's own subjective imaginings. The cognitive distortion introduced by conceiving consists, in brief, in the intrusion of the egocentric perspective into the experience already slightly distorted by spontaneous perception. According to the commentaries, the activity of conceiving is governed by three defilements, which account for the different ways it comes to manifestation — craving <i>(taṇhā)</i> , conceit <i>(māna )</i>, and views <i>(diṭṭhi)</i>.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p"><a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> paraphrases this text thus: "Having perceived earth with a perverted perception, the ordinary person afterwards conceives it — construes or discriminates it — through the gross proliferating tendencies <i>(papañca)</i> of craving, conceit, and views, which are here called ‘conceivings. ’ … He apprehends it in diverse ways contrary [to reality]."</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">The four ways of conceiving <i>(maññanā)</i>: The Buddha shows that the conceiving of any object may occur in any of four ways, expressed by the text as a fourfold linguistic pattern: accusative, locative, ablative, and appropriative. The primary significance of this modal pattern — enigmatic in the Pali as well — seems to be ontological. I take the pattern to represent the diverse ways in which the ordinary person attempts to give positive being to his imagined sense of egohood by positing,below the threshold of reflection, a relationship between himself as the subject of cognition and the perceived phenomenon as its object. According to the fourfold pattern given, this relationship may be one either of direct identification ["he conceives X"], or of inherence ["he conceives in X"], or of contrast or derivation ["he conceives from X"], or of simple appropriation ["he conceives X to be ‘mine’"].</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">But care is needed in interpreting these phrases. The Pali does not supply any direct object for the second and third modes, and this suggests that the process at work in conceiving proceeds from a deeper and more general level than that involved in the forming of an explicit view of self, as described for example at <a href="mn2.html#p9">MN&nbsp;2.8</a> or <a href="mn44.html#p8">MN&nbsp;44.7</a>. The activity of conceiving thus seems to comprise the entire raṅge of subjectively tinged cognition, from the impulses and thoughts in which the sense of personal identity is still inchoate to elaborate intellectual structures in which it has been fully explicated.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">Ñm, however, understands the implicit object of conceiving to be the percept itself, and accordingly translates: "having had from earth a percept of earth, he conceives [that to be] earth, he conceives [that to be] in earth, he conceives [that to be apart] from earth," etc.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">The fifth phrase, "he delights in X," explicitly connects conceiving with craving, which is elsewhere said to "delight here and there." This, moreover, hints at the danger in the worldling's thought processes, since craving is pointed to by the Buddha as the origin of suffering.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">MA gives prolific examples illustrating all the different modes of conceiving, and these clearly establish that the intended object of conceiving is the misplaced sense of egoity.</span></span></span> Why is that? Because he has not fully understood it, I say.<span class="note" id="n7"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.7] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> states that one who fully understands earth does so by the three types of full understanding: the full understanding of the known <i>(ñātapariññā)</i> — the definition of the earth element by way of its unique characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause; the full understanding by scrutinization <i>(tīraṇapariññā)</i> — the contemplation of the earth element by way of the three general characteristics of impermanence, suffering, and non-self; and the full understanding of abandonment <i>(pahānapariññā)</i> — the abandoning of desire and lust for the earth element through the supreme path [of arahantship].</span></span></span></p>

MA exemplifies the application of the three types of conceiving to this situation as follows: When a person becomes attached to beings as a result of sight, hearing, etc., or desires rebirth in a certain class of beings, this is conceiving due to craving. When he ranks himself as superior, equal, or inferior to others, this is conceiving due to conceit. And when he thinks, "Beings are permanent, stable, eternal," etc., this is conceiving due to views.</span></span></span> Having perceived beings as beings, he conceives beings, he conceives <span class="add">himself</span> in beings, he conceives <span class="add">himself apart</span> from beings, he conceives beings to be ‘mine,’ he delights in beings.

The arahant is sometimes described as <i>asekha,</i> one beyond training, in the sense that he has completed the training in the Noble Eightfold Path. <a href="mn0-abbr.html">Ñm</a> rendered <i>sekha</i> as "initiate" and <i>asekha</i> as "adept," which have been changed here to avoid their "esoteric" connotations.</span></span></span> whose mind has not yet reached the goal, and who is still aspiring to the supreme security from bondage, directly knows earth as earth.<span class="note" id="n22"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.22] It should be noted that, whereas the ordinary man is said to perceive each of the bases, the one in higher training is said to directly know them <i>(abhijānāti)</i>. <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains that he knows them with distinguished knowledge, knows them in accordance with their real nature as impermanent, suffering, and non-self.

With his attainment of stream-entry he eradicated the fetter of identity view and thus can no longer conceive in terms of wrong views. But the defilements of craving and conceit are only uprooted by the path of arahantship, and thus the sekha remains vulnerable to the conceivings to which they are capable of giving rise. Whereas direct knowledge <i>(abhiñña)</i> is the province of both the sekha and the arahant, full understanding <i>(pariññā)</i> is the province exclusively of the arahant, as it involves the full abandoning of all defilements.</span></span></span></p>

Why is that? Because he has understood that delight is the root of suffering, and that with being <span class="add">as condition</span> there is birth, and that for whatever has come to be there is ageing and death.<span class="note" id="n29"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.29] This sentence gives a highly compressed statement of the formula of dependent origination <i>(paṭicca samuppāda)</i>, usually expounded in twelve factors <span class="add">as in <a href="mn38.html">MN&nbsp;38</a></span>. As interpreted by <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA,</a> "delight" is the craving of the previous life that brought into being the "suffering" of the five aggregates in the present life, "being" the kammically determinative aspect of the present life that causes future birth, followed by future ageing and death. This passage shows the cause for the Buddha’s elimination of conceiving to be his penetration of dependent origination on the night of his enlightenment. The mention of "delight" <i>(nandī)</i> as the root of suffering links up with the sutta's title; moreover, by referring to the earlier statement that the ordinary person delights in earth, etc., it shows suffering to be the ultimate consequence of delight.</span></span></span> Therefore, bhikkhus, through the complete destruction, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of cravings, the Tathāgata has awakened to supreme full enlightenment, I say.<span class="note" id="n30"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.30] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains the sequence of ideas thus: The Tathāgata does not conceive earth and does not delight in earth because he has understood that delight is the root of suffering. Further, by understanding dependent origination, he has completely abandoned the craving here called " delight " and has awakened to supreme full enlightenment. As a result he does not conceive earth or delight in earth.</span></span></span></p>

At a later time, MA tells us, when their pride had been humbled, the Buddha expounded to these same bhikkhus the Gotamaka Sutta (<a href="../an/an3.125.html">AN3.125</a>), in the course of which they all attained arahantship.</span></span></span></p>
