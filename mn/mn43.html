<div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

<p>Then, when it was evening, the venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita rose from meditation, went to the venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.<span class="note" id="n428"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.428] Ven. Mahā Koṭṭhita was declared by the Buddha the foremost disciple of those who have attained the analytical knowledges <i>(paṭisambhidā)</i></span></span></span> When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side and said to the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

<h3><span class="add">Wisdom</span></h3>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"‘One who is unwise, one who is unwise’ is said, friend. With reference to what is this said, ‘one who is unwise’?"</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>" ‘One does not wisely understand, one does not wisely understand,’ friend; that is why it is said, ‘one who is unwise.’ And what doesn’t one wisely understand? One does not wisely understand: ‘This is suffering’; one does not wisely understand: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; one does not wisely understand: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; one does not wisely understand: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’ ‘One does not wisely understand, one does not wisely understand,’ friend; that is why it is said, ‘one who is unwise.’ "</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Saying, "Good, friend," the venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita delighted and rejoiced in the venerable Sāriputta′s words. Then he asked him a further question:</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"‘One who is wise, one who is wise,’ is said, friend. With reference to what is this said, ‘one who is wise’?"</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"‘One wisely understands, one wisely understands,’ friend; that is why it is said, ‘one who is wise.’ What does one wisely understand? One wisely understands: ‘This is suffering’; one wisely understands: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; one wisely understands: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; one wisely understands: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering. ’ ‘One wisely understands, one wisely understands,’ friend; that is why it is said, ‘one who is wise.′"<span class="note" id="n429"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.429] According to <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>, the understanding of the Four Noble Truths being discussed here is penetration by the supramundane path. Thus the lowest type of person to be described as "one who is wise" <i>(paññavā)</i> is the person on the path of stream-entry. The rendering of <i>paññā</i> as "wisdom" (which I substituted for Ñm's "understanding") has the disadvantage of severing the tie, evident in the Pali, with the verb <i>pajānāti.</i> To preserve the connection, here and in the preceding paragraph, the verb has been rendered "wisely understand."</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span class="add">Consciousness</span></h3>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>" ‘Consciousness, consciousness’ is said, friend. With reference to what is ‘consciousness’ said?"</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>" ‘It cognizes, it cognizes,’ friend; that is why ‘consciousness’ is said.<span class="note" id="n430"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.430] The Pali phrase defining consciousness uses only the verb, <i>vijānāti vijānāti,</i> and this could as well be understood to mean "One cognizes, one cognizes." Although Ñm had translated this phrase without any pronoun, the pronoun has been inserted for greater intelligibility. The renderings of the verb definitions of feeling and perception at ¶11 and ¶13 have been similarly augmented by the addition of the pronoun.</span></span></span> What does it cognize? It cognizes: ‘<span class="add">This is</span> pleasant’; it cognizes: ‘<span class="add">This is</span> painful’; it cognizes: ‘<span class="add">This is</span> neither-painful-nor-pleasant.’ ‘It cognizes, it cognizes,’ friend; that is why ‘consciousness’ is said."<span class="note" id="n431"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.431] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> The question concerns the consciousness with which the person described as "one who is wise" examines formations; that is, the consciousness of insight by which that person arrived <span class="add">at his attainment</span>, the mind which does the work of meditation. Ven. Sāriputta answers by explaining the meditation subject of feeling, in the way it has come down in the Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness (<a href="mn10.html#p29">MN10.32</a>). The Pali construction, <i>sukhan ti pi vijānāti,</i> indicates that the feeling is being treated as a direct object of consciousness rather than as an affective tone of the experience; to show this the words "this is" have been supplied in brackets and the entire phrase set in quotation marks.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"Wisdom and consciousness, friend — are these states conjoined or disjoined? And is it possible to separate each of these states from the other in order to describe the difference between them?"</p>

<p>"Wisdom and consciousness, friend — these states are conjoined, not disjoined, and it is impossible to separate each of these states from the other in order to describe the difference between them. For what one wisely understands, that one cognizes, and what one cognizes, that one wisely understands. That is why these states are conjoined, not disjoined, and it is impossible to separate each of these states from the other in order to describe the difference between them."<span class="note" id="n432"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.432] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> This statement refers to the wisdom and consciousness on the occasions of both insight and the supramundane path. The two are conjoined in that they arise and cease simultaneously and share a single sense base and object. However, the two are not inseparably conjoined since, while wisdom always requires consciousness, consciousness can occur without wisdom.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"What is the difference, friend, between wisdom and consciousness, these states that are conjoined, not disjoined?"</p>

<p>"The difference, friend, between wisdom and consciousness, these states that are conjoined, not disjoined, is this: wisdom is to be developed, consciousness is to be fully understood."<span class="note" id="n433"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.433] Wisdom, being the path factor of right view, is to be developed as a factor of the path. Consciousness, being included among the five aggregates that pertain to the noble truth of suffering, is to be fully understood — as impermanent, suffering, and not self.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span class="add">Feeling</span></h3>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"‘Feeling, feeling’ is said, friend. With reference to what is ‘feeling’ said?"</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"‘It feels, it feels,’ friend; that is why ‘feeling’ is said. What does it feel? It feels pleasure, it feels pain, it feels neither-pain-nor-pleasure. ‘It feels, it feels,’ friend, that is why ‘feeling’ is said."<span class="note" id="n434"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.434] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> says that the question and reply refer to mundane feelings that are the objective range of insight. The Pali construction here, <i>sukham pi vedeti,</i> etc., shows feeling as simultaneously a quality of the object and an affective tone of the experience by which it is apprehended. MA points out that feeling itself feels; there is no other (separate) feeler.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span class="add">Perception</span></h3>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"‘Perception, perception,’ is said, friend. With reference to what is ‘perception’ said?"</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"‘It perceives, it perceives,’ friend; that is why ‘perception’ is said. What does it perceive? It perceives blue, it perceives yellow, it perceives red, and it perceives white. ‘It perceives, it perceives, ’ friend; that is why ‘perception’ is said."<span class="note" id="n435"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.435] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> The question and reply refer to mundane perceptions that are the objective range of insight.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Feeling, perception, and consciousness, friend — are these states conjoined or disjoined? And is it possible to separate each of these states from the others in order to describe the difference between them?"</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"Feeling, perception, and consciousness, friend — these states are conjoined, not disjoined, and it is impossible to separate each of these states from the others in order to describe the difference between them. For what one feels, that one perceives; and what one perceives, that one cognizes. That is why these states are conjoined, not disjoined, and it is impossible to separate each of these states from the others in order to describe the difference between them."<span class="note" id="n436"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.436] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> Wisdom has been excluded from this exchange because the intention is to show only the states that are conjoined on every occasion of consciousness.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span class="add">Knowable by Mind Alone</span></h3>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"Friend, what can be known by purified mind-consciousness released from the five faculties?"</p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>"Friend, by purified mind-consciousness released from the five faculties the base of infinite space can be known thus: ‘Space is infinite’; the base of infinite consciousness can be known thus: ‘Consciousness is infinite’; and the base of nothingness can be known thus: ‘There is nothing.′"<span class="note" id="n437"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.437] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> Purified mind-consciousness <i>(parisuddha manoviññāṇa )</i> is the consciousness of the fourth jhāna. It can know the immaterial attainments insofar as one established in the fourth jhāna is capable of reaching them. The base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception is excluded here because, owing to its subtlety, it does not come into the direct range of contemplation for the attainment of insight.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>"Friend, with what does one understand a state that can be known?"</p>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>"Friend, one understands a state that can be known with the eye of wisdom."<span class="note" id="n438"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.438] MA: The eye of wisdom <i>(paññ̄ācakkhu)</i> is wisdom itself, called an eye in the sense that it is an organ of spiritual vision.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>"Friend, what is the purpose of wisdom?"</p>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>"The purpose of wisdom, friend, is direct knowledge, its purpose is full understanding, its purpose is abandoning."<span class="note" id="n439"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.439] For the distinction between direct knowledge <i>(abhiññā)</i> and full understanding <i>(pariññā)</i>, see <a href="mn1.html#n23">n.23.</a></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span class="add">Right View</span></h3>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>"Friend, how many conditions are there for the arising of right view?"</p>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>"Friend, there are two conditions for the arising of right view: the voice of another and wise attention. These are the two conditions for the arising of right view."<span class="note" id="n440"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.440] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> "The voice of another" <i>(parato ghosa)</i> is the teaching of beneficial Dhamma. These two conditions are necessary for disciples to arrive at the right view of insight and the right view of the supramundane path. But paccekabuddhas arrive at their enlightenment and fully enlightened Buddhas at omniscience solely in dependence on wise attention without "the voice of another."</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>"Friend, by how many factors is right view assisted when it has deliverance of mind for its fruit, deliverance of mind for its fruit and benefit, when it has deliverance by wisdom for its fruit, deliverance by wisdom for its fruit and benefit?"</p>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>"Friend, right view is assisted by five factors when it has deliverance of mind for its fruit, deliverance of mind for its fruit and benefit, when it has deliverance by wisdom for its fruit, deliverance by wisdom for its fruit and benefit. Here, friend, right view is assisted by virtue, learning, discussion, serenity, and insight. Right view assisted by these five factors has deliverance of mind for its fruit, deliverance of mind for its fruit and benefit; it has deliverance by wisdom for its fruit, deliverance by wisdom for its fruit and benefit."<span class="note" id="n441"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.441] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> Right view here is the right view pertaining to the path of arahantship. "Deliverance of mind" and "deliverance by wisdom" both refer to the fruit of arahantship; see <a href="mn6.html#n83">n.83.</a> When one fulfils these five factors, the path of arahantship arises and yields its fruit.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span class="add">Being</span></h3>

<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>"Friend, how many kinds of being are there?"</p>

<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>"There are these three kinds of being, friend: sense-sphere being, fine-material being, and immaterial being."</p>

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>"Friend, how is renewal of being in the future generated?"</p>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>"Friend, renewal of being in the future is generated through the delighting in this and that on the part of beings who are hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving."<span class="note" id="n442"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.442] "Renewal of being in the future" <i>(āyatiṁ punabbhavābhinibbatti )</i> is rebirth, the continuation of the round. This question and the next may be regarded as synoptic approaches to the entire twelvefold formula of dependent origination laid out in <a href="mn38.html#p42">MN&nbsp;38.17</a> and 20.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p30"><span class="parno">30</span>"Friend, how is renewal of being in the future not generated?"</p>

<p id="p31"><span class="parno">31</span>"Friend, with the fading away of ignorance, with the arising of true knowledge, and with the cessation of craving, renewal of being in the future is not generated."</p>

<h3><span class="add">The First Jhāna</span></h3>

<p id="p32"><span class="parno">32</span>"Friend, what is the first jhāna?"</p>

<p id="p33"><span class="parno">33</span>"Here, friend, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. This is called the first jhāna."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p34"><span class="parno">34</span>"Friend, how many factors does the first jhāna have?"</p>

<p id="p35"><span class="parno">35</span>"Friend, the first jhāna has five factors. Here, when a bhikkhu has entered upon the first jhāna, there occur applied thought, sustained thought, rapture, pleasure, and unification of mind. That is how the first jhāna has five factors."</p>

<p id="p36"><span class="parno">36</span>"Friend, how many factors are abandoned in the first jhāna and how many factors are possessed?"</p>

<p id="p37"><span class="parno">37</span>"Friend, in the first jhāna five factors are abandoned and five factors are possessed. Here, when a bhikkhu has entered upon the first jhāna, sensual desire is abandoned, ill will is abandoned, sloth and torpor are abandoned, restlessness and remorse are abandoned, and doubt is abandoned; and there occur applied thought, sustained thought, rapture, pleasure, and unification of mind. That is how in the first jhāna five factors are abandoned and five factors are possessed."</p>

<h3><span class="add">The Five Faculties</span></h3>

<p id="p38"><span class="parno">38</span>"Friend, these five faculties each have a separate field, a separate domain, and do not experience each other's field and domain, that is, the eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, and the body faculty. Now of these five faculties, each having a separate field, a separate domain, not experiencing each other's field and domain, what is their resort, what experiences their fields and domains?"<span class="note" id="n443"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.443] The five outer sense faculties each have their own unique object — forms for the eye, sounds for the ear, etc. — but the mind faculty is able to experience the objects of all five sense faculties as well as the mental objects exclusive to itself. Hence the other five faculties have mind as their resort <i>(manopaṭisaraṇaṁ)</i>.</span></span></span></p>

This special meditative attainment, in which all mental activity ceases, is accessible only to non-returners and arahants who also have mastery over the eight attainments on the side of serenity. For a brief discussion see the Introduction, p. 41, and for the full scholastic account, Vsm XXIII, 16–52. The cessation of perception and feeling will be taken up again in <a href="mn44.html">MN&nbsp;44</a>.</span></span></span> If vital formations were things that can be felt, then a bhikkhu who has entered upon the cessation of perception and feeling would not be seen to emerge from it.
