<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Then the brahmin Saṅgārava approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One.</p>

<p>"Master Gotama, why is it that sometimes even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind, let alone those that have not been so recited? Why is it that sometimes even those hymns that have not been recited over a long period recur to the mind, let alone those that have been so recited?.</p>

In relation to the hindrance of sensual desire, escape by suppression <i>(vikkhambhananissaraṇa)</i> occurs through the first jhāna based on the unattractive nature of the body, escape in a particular respect <i>(tadaṅganissaraṇa)</i> through insight, and escape by eradication <i>(samucchedanissaraṇa)</i> through the path of arahantship (broadly interpreting <i>kāmacchanda</i> as craving for any object). (ii) The escape from <i>ill will</i> occurs by suppression through the first jhāna based on loving-kindness, and by eradication through the path of the non-returner. (iii) The escape from <i>dullness and drowsiness</i> occurs by suppression through the perception of light (the visualization of a bright light) and by eradication through the path of arahantship. (iv) The escape from <i>restlessness and remorse</i> occurs by suppression through serenity—<i>remorse</i> being then eradicated through the path of the non-returner and <i>restlessness</i> through the path of arahantship. And (v) the escape from <i>doubt</i> occurs by suppression through the defining of phenomena <i>(dhammavavatthāna</i>; see Vism 587–93, Ppn 18.3–24) and by eradication through the path of stream-entry. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> does not apply "escape in a particular respect" to the last four hindrances, but Mp-ṭ says it occurs in that the hindrances can be dispelled by reflection <i>(paṭisaṅkhānavasena tassa vinodetabbatāya tadaṅganissaraṇampi labbhat’eva)</i>.</span></span></span> on that occasion one does not know and see as it really is one's own good, the good of others, and the good of both.<span class="note" id="n1193"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1193] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> interprets these terms from a monastic perspective. One's own good <i>(attattha)</i> is arahantship, and the good of others <i>(parattha)</i> is the welfare of the lay supporters who provide one with material support (because the offering of such gifts creates merit).</span></span></span> Then even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind, let alone those that have not been so recited.
