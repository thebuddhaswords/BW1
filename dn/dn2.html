<h3>Statements of the Ministers</h3>

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Exalted One was dwelling at Rājagaha, in Jīvaka Komārabhacca's<span class="note" id="n91"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.91] The royal physician. <a href="../mn/mn55.html">MN&nbsp;55</a> (on meat-eating) is addressed to him. See <a href="dn26.html#n417">n.417.</a></span></span></span> Mango Grove, together with a large company of twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus. At the time, on the fifteenth-day Uposatha,<span class="note" id="n93"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.93] <i>Uposatha</i> (Skt. <i>upavasatha</i>): here denotes a Brahmin fast-day. Later, in Buddhism the fortnightly day of confession for monks.</span></span></span> the full-moon night of Komudī<span class="note" id="n95"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.95] Called after the white water-lily (<i>kumuda</i>) which blooms then.</span></span></span> in the fourth month.<span class="note" id="n94"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.94] Kattika: mid-October to mid-November.</span></span></span> King Ajātasattu of Magadha,<span class="note" id="n92"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.92] Reigned ca. 491–459 BCE. He had killed his father, the noble Bimbisāra, to gain the throne. See further <a href="dn16.html#n365">n.365.</a></span></span></span> the son of Queen Videhā, was sitting on the upper terrace of his palace surrounded by his ministers. There the king uttered the following joyful exclamation:</p>

<p>"How delightful, friends, is this moonlit night! How beautiful is this moonlit night! How lovely is this moonlit night! How tranquil is this moonlit night! How auspicious is this moonlit night! Is there any recluse or brahmin that we could visit tonight who might be able to bring peace to my mind?"<span class="note" id="n96"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.96] Ajātasattu was troubled in conscience on account of his crime: see verse 99.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Thereupon one of his ministers said: "Your majesty, there is Pūraṇa Kassapa, the leader of an order, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, well-known and famous, a spiritual leader whom many people esteem as holy. He is aged, long gone forth, advanced in years, in the last phase of life. Your majesty should visit him. Perhaps he might bring peace to your mind." But when this was said, King Ajātasattu remained silent.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">3–7</span>Other ministers said: "Your majesty, there is Makkhali Gosāla … Ajita Kesakambala … Pakudha Kaccāyana … Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta … Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, the leader of an order, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, well-known and famous, a spiritual leader whom many people esteem as holy. He is aged, long gone forth, advanced in years, in the last phase of life. Your majesty should visit him. Perhaps he might bring peace to your mind." But when this was said, King Ajātasattu remained silent.</p>

<h3>The Statement of Jīvaka Komārabhacca</h3>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>All this time Jīvaka Komārabhacca sat silently not far from King Ajātasattu. The king then said to him: "Friend Jīvaka, why do you keep silent?"</p>

<p>Jīvaka said: "Your majesty, the Exalted One, the Worthy One, the perfectly enlightened Buddha, together with a large company of twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus, is now dwelling in our Mango Grove. A favourable report concerning him is circulating thus: 'This Exalted One is a worthy one, perfectly enlightened, endowed with clear knowledge and conduct, accomplished, a knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of men to be tamed,<span class="note" id="n97"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.97] One who trains men (who are capable of being trained) as a charioteer trains horses.</span></span></span> teacher of gods and men, enlightened and exalted.' Your majesty should visit the Exalted One. Perhaps if you visit him he might bring peace to your mind."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"Then get the elephant vehicles prepared, friend Jīvaka."</p>

<p>"Yes, your majesty!" Jīvaka replied. He then had five hundred female elephants prepared, as well as the king's personal bull-elephant, and announced to the king: "Your majesty, your elephant vehicles are ready. Do as you think fit."</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>King Ajātasattu then had five hundred of his women mounted on the female elephants, one on each, while he himself mounted his personal bull-elephant. With his attendants carrying torches, he went forth from Rājagaha in full royal splendour, setting out in the direction of Jīvaka's Mango Grove.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>When King Ajātasattu was not far from the Mango Grove, he was suddenly gripped by fear, trepidation, and terror. Frightened, agitated, and terror-stricken, he said to Jīvaka: "You aren't deceiving me, are you, friend Jīvaka? You aren't betraying me? You aren't about to turn me over to my enemies? How could there be such a large company of bhikkhus, twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus, without any sound of sneezing or coughing, or any noise at all?"</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"Do not be afraid, great king. Do not be afraid. I am not deceiving you, your majesty, or betraying you, or turning you over to your enemies. Go forward, great king! Go straight forward! Those are lamps burning in the pavilion hall."</p>

<h3>The Question on the Fruits of Recluseship</h3>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>Then King Ajātasattu, having gone by elephant as far as he could, dismounted and approached the door of the pavilion hall on foot. Having approached, he asked Jīvaka: "But where, Jīvaka, is the Exalted One?"</p>

<p>"That is the Exalted One, great king. He is the one sitting against the middle pillar, facing east, in front of the company of bhikkhus."</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>King Ajātasattu then approached the Exalted One and stood to one side. As he stood there surveying the company of bhikkhus, which sat in complete silence as serene as a calm lake, he uttered the following joyful exclamation: "May my son, the Prince Udāyibhadda,<span class="note" id="n98"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.98] The son who was eventually to kill him, only to be murdered in turn by his son. It evidently ran in the family (see DPPN).</span></span></span> enjoy such peace as the company of bhikkhus now enjoys!"</p>

<hr>
<p>(The Exalted One said:) "Do your thoughts, great king, follow the call of your affection?"</p>

<p>"Venerable sir, I love my son, the Prince Udāyibhadda. May he enjoy such peace as the company of bhikkhus now enjoys."</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>King Ajātasattu then paid homage to the Exalted One, reverently saluted the company of bhikkhus, sat down to one side, and said to the Exalted One: "Venerable sir, I would like to ask the Exalted One about a certain point, if he would take the time to answer my question."</p>

<p>"Ask whatever you wish to, great king."</p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"There are, venerable sir, various crafts, such as elephant trainers, horse trainers, charioteers, archers, standard bearers, camp marshals, commandos, high royal officers, front-line soldiers, bull-warriors, military heroes, mail-clad warriors, domestic slaves, confectioners, barbers, bath attendants, cooks, garland-makers, laundrymen, weavers, basket-makers, potters, statisticians, accountants, and various other crafts of a similar nature. All those (who practise these crafts) enjoy here and now the visible fruits of their crafts. They obtain happiness and joy themselves, and they give happiness and joy to their parents, wives and children, and their friends and colleagues. They establish an excellent presentation of gifts to recluses and brahmins—leading to heaven, ripening in happiness, conducing to a heavenly rebirth. Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out any fruit of recluseship that is similarly visible here and now?"</p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>"Do you remember, great king, ever asking other recluses and brahmins this question?"</p>

<p>"I do remember asking them, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"If it isn't troublesome for you, please tell us how they answered."</p>

<p>"It is not troublesome for me, venerable sir, when the Exalted One or anyone like him is present."</p>

<p>"Then speak, great king."</p>

<h4>The Doctrine of Pūraṇa Kassapa</h4>

<p id="18"><span class="parno">18</span>"One time, I approached Pūraṇa Kassapa,<span class="note" id="n99"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.99] A naked wanderer (DA). Such views as his, involving a denial of any reward or punishment for good and bad deeds, are regarded as especially pernicious.</span></span></span> exchanged greetings and courtesies with him, and sat down to one side. I then asked him (<i>as in</i> §16) if he could point out any fruit of recluseship visible here and now.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>"When I had finished speaking, Pūraṇa Kassapa said to me: 'Great king, if one acts or induces others to act, mutilates or induces others to mutilate, tortures or induces others to torture, inflicts sorrow or induces others to inflict sorrow, oppresses or induces others to oppress, intimidates or induces others to intimidate; if one destroys life, takes what is not given, breaks into houses, plunders wealth, commits burglary, ambushes highways, commits adultery, speaks falsehood—one does no evil. If with a razor-edged disk one were to reduce all the living beings on this earth to a single heap and pile of flesh, by doing so there would be no evil or outcome of evil. If one were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing and inducing others to kill, mutilating and inducing others to mutilate, torturing and inducing others to torture, by doing so there would be no evil or outcome of evil. If one were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving gifts and inducing others to give gifts, making offerings and inducing others to make offerings, by doing so there would be no merit or outcome of merit. By giving, self-control, restraint, and truthful speech there is no merit or outcome of merit.'</p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>"Thus, venerable sir, when I asked Pūraṇa Kassapa about a visible fruit of recluseship, he explained to me (his doctrine of) the inefficacy of action. Venerable sir, just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit, or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango, in the same way when I asked Pūraṇa Kassapa about a visible fruit of recluseship he explained to me (his doctrine of) the inefficacy of action. Then, venerable sir, I thought to myself: 'One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse or brahmin living in his realm.'<span class="note" id="n100"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.100] Probably owing to his bad conscience. But the remark also suggests the enormous (and not always deserved) respect in which such wandering teachers were held.</span></span></span> So I neither rejoiced in the statement of Pūraṇa Kassapa nor did I reject it. But, though I neither rejoiced in it nor rejected it, I still felt dissatisfied, yet did not utter a word of dissatisfaction. Without accepting his doctrine, without embracing it, I got up from my seat and left.</p>

<h3>The Doctrine of Makkhali Gosāla</h3>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>"Another time, venerable sir, I approached Makkhali Gosāla,<span class="note" id="n101"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.101] ‘Makkhali of the Cow-Pen’, leader of the Ajivikas. See <a href="#n66">n.66.</a></span></span></span> exchanged greetings and courtesies with him, and sat down to one side. I then asked him (<i>as in</i> §16) if he could point out a fruit of recluseship visible here and now.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>"When I had finished speaking, Makkhali Gosāla said to me: 'Great king, there is no cause or condition<span class="note" id="n102"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.102] <i>Hetu</i> means ‘root’ (e.g. greed, hatred or delusion); <i>paccaya</i> means ‘condition’.</span></span></span> for the defilement of beings; beings are defiled without any cause or condition. There is no cause or condition for the purification of beings; beings are purified without cause or condition. There is no self-determination, no determination by others, no personal determination. There is no power, no energy, no personal strength, no personal fortitude. All sentient beings, all living beings, all creatures, all souls, are helpless, powerless, devoid of energy. Undergoing transformation by destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of men.</p>

<p>'There are fourteen hundred thousand principal modes of origin (for living beings) and six thousand (others) and six hundred (others). There are five hundred kinds of kamma<span class="note" id="n103"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.103] <i>Kamma</i>: but not quite in the Buddhist sense of ‘volitional action’.</span></span></span> and five kinds of kamma<span class="note" id="n104"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.104] According to the five outward senses (cf. <a href="#n87">n.87</a>).</span></span></span> and three kinds of kamma<span class="note" id="n105"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.105] Of thought, word and deed.</span></span></span> and full kamma and half-kamma.<span class="note" id="n106"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.106] </span></span></span>‘Half-action’, in thought only. There are sixty-two pathways, sixty-two sub-aeons, six classes of men, eight stages in the life of man, forty-nine hundred modes of livelihood, forty-nine hundred kinds of wanderers, forty-nine hundred abodes of Nāgas,<span class="note" id="n107"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.107] Basically, serpent-deities.</span></span></span> two thousand faculties, three thousand hells, thirty-six realms of dust, seven spheres of percipient beings, seven spheres of non-percipient beings, seven kinds of jointed plants,<span class="note" id="n108"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.108] <i>Nigaṇṭhi-gabbhā:</i> ‘rebirths as a Nigaṇṭha’. See <a href="#n114">114</a></span></span></span> seven kinds of gods, seven kinds of human beings, seven kinds of demons, seven great lakes, seven major kinds of knots, seven hundred minor kinds of knots,<span class="note" id="n109"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.109] Both the form (<i>paṭuvā, pavuṭā?</i>) seven major precipices, and the meaning of this word are doubtful.</span></span></span> seven hundred minor precipices, seven major kinds of dreams, seven hundred minor kinds of dreams, eighty-four hundred thousand great aeons. The foolish and the wise, having roamed and wandered through these, will alike make an end to suffering.</p>

<p>'Though one might think: "By this moral discipline or observance or austerity or holy life I will ripen unripened kamma and eliminate ripened kamma whenever it comes up"— that cannot be.<span class="note" id="n110"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.110] The Buddhist view of kamma is thus denied.</span></span></span> For pleasure and pain are measured out. Saṁsāra's limits are fixed, and they can neither be shortened nor extended. There is no advancing forward and no falling back. Just as, when a ball of string is thrown, it rolls along unwinding until it comes to its end, in the same way, the foolish and the wise roam and wander (for the fixed length of time), after which they make an end to suffering.'</p>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>"Thus, venerable sir, when I asked Makkhali Gosāla about a visible fruit of recluseship, he explained to me (his doctrine of) purification through wandering in saṁsāra. Venerable sir, just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit, or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango, in the same way, when I asked Makkhali Gosāla about a visible fruit of recluseship, he explained to me (his doctrine of) purification through wandering in saṁsāra. Then, venerable sir, I thought to myself: 'One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse or brahmin living in his realm.' So I neither rejoiced in the statement of Makkhali Gosāla nor did I reject it. But, though I neither rejoiced in it nor rejected it, I still felt dissatisfied, yet did not utter a word of dissatisfaction. Without accepting his doctrine, without embracing it, I got up from my seat and left.</p>

<h4>The Doctrine of Ajita Kesakambala</h4>

<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>"Another time, venerable sir, I approached Ajita Kesakambala,<span class="note" id="n111"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.111] ‘Ajita of the Hairy Garment’ (he wore a cloak of human hair): a materialist.</span></span></span> exchanged greetings and courtesies with him, and sat down to one side. I then asked him (<i>as in</i> §16) if he could point out a fruit of recluseship visible here and now.</p>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>"When I had finished speaking, Ajita Kesakambala said to me: 'Great king, there is no giving, no offering, no liberality. There is no fruit or result of good and bad actions. There is no present world, no world beyond, no mother, no father, no beings who have taken rebirth.<span class="note" id="n112"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.112] Cf. <a href="dn1.html#n49">n.49</a> and <a href="dn1.html#n63">n.63.</a></span></span></span> In the world there are no recluses and brahmins of right attainment and right practice who explain this world and the world beyond on the basis of their own direct knowledge and realization. A person is composed of the four primary elements. When he dies, the earth (in his body) returns to and merges with the (external) body of earth; the water (in his body) returns to and merges with the (external) body of water; the fire (in his body) returns to and merges with the (external) body of fire; the air (in his body) returns to and merges with the (external) body of air. His sense faculties pass over into space. Four men carry the corpse along on a bier. His eulogies are sounded until they reach the charnel ground. His bones turn pigeon-coloured. His meritorious offerings end in ashes. The practice of giving is a doctrine of fools. Those who declare that there is (an afterlife) speak only false, empty prattle. With the breaking up of the body, the foolish and the wise alike are annihilated and utterly perish. They do not exist after death.'</p>

<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>"Thus, venerable sir, when I asked Ajita Kesakambala about a visible fruit of recluseship, he explained to me (his doctrine of) annihilation. Venerable sir, just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit, or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango, in the same way, when I asked Ajita Kesakambala about a visible fruit of recluseship, he explained to me (his doctrine of) annihilation. Then, venerable sir, I thought to myself: 'One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse or brahmin living in his realm.' So I neither rejoiced in the statement of Ajita Kesakambala nor did I reject it. But though I neither rejoiced in it nor rejected it, I still felt dissatisfied, yet did not utter a word of dissatisfaction. Without accepting his doctrine, without embracing it, I got up from my seat and left.</p>

<h4>The Doctrine of Pakudha Kaccāyana</h4>

<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>"Another time, venerable sir, I approached Pakudha Kaccāyana,<span class="note" id="n113"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.113] Holder of an atomic theory.</span></span></span> exchanged greetings and courtesies with him, and sat down to one side. I then asked him (<i>as in</i> §16) if he could point out a fruit of recluseship visible here and now.</p>

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>"When I had finished speaking, Pakudha Kaccāyana said to me: 'Great king, there are seven bodies that are unmade, unfashioned, uncreated, without a creator, barren, stable as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They do not alter, do not change, do not obstruct one another; they are incapable of causing one another either pleasure or pain, or both pleasure and pain. What are the seven? The body of earth, the body of water, the body of fire, the body of air, pleasure, pain, and the soul as the seventh. Among these there is no killer nor one who causes killing; no hearer nor one who causes hearing; no cognizer nor one who causes cognition. If someone were to cut off (another person's) head with a sharp sword, he would not be taking (the other's) life. The sword merely passes through the space between the seven bodies.'</p>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>"Thus, venerable sir, when I asked Pakudha Kaccāyana about a visible fruit of recluseship, he answered me in a completely irrelevant way. Venerable sir, just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit, or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango, in the same way, when I asked Pakudha Kaccāyana about a visible fruit of recluseship, he answered me in a completely irrelevant way. Then, venerable sir, I thought to myself: 'One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse or brahmin living in his realm.' So I neither rejoiced in the statement of Pakudha Kaccāyana nor did I reject it. But though I neither rejoiced in it nor rejected it, I still felt dissatisfied, yet did not utter a word of dissatisfaction. Without accepting his doctrine, without embracing it, I got up from my seat and left.</p>

<h4>The Doctrine of Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta</h4>

<p id="p30"><span class="parno">30</span>"Another time, venerable sir, I approached Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta,<span class="note" id="n114"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.114] The name given in the Pali Canon to Vardhamana Mahāvīra (ca. 540—568 BCE?), the leader of the Jains. He is several times referred to (unfavourably) in the Canon, e.g. at <a href="../mn/mn56.html">MN&nbsp;56.</a> Nigaṇṭha means ‘free from bonds’. See next note and <a href="dn29.html#900">n.900.</a></span></span></span> exchanged greetings and courtesies with him, and sat down to one side. I then asked him (<i>as in</i> §16) if he could point out a fruit of recluseship visible here and now.</p>

<p id="p31"><span class="parno">31</span>"When I had finished speaking, Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said to me: 'Great king, a Nigaṇṭha, a knotless one, is restrained with a fourfold restraint.<span class="note" id="n115"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.115] <i>Sabba-vāri-vārito, sabba-vāri-yuto, sabba-vāri-dhuto, sabba-vāri-phuṭṭo</i> (with some variant readings). They do not represent the genuine Jain teaching but seem to parody it in punning form. The Jains do have a rule of restraint in regard to water, and vāri can mean ‘water’, ‘restraint’, or possibly ‘sin’, and some of the verbal forms are equally dubious. The reference to one ‘free from bonds’ and yet bound by these restraints (whatever they are) is a deliberate paradox. I am most grateful to K.R. Norman for his very helpful comments. Finally I settled for a slight variation on the Ven. Ñāṇamoli’s rendering of the corresponding passage in <a href="../mn/mn56.html">MN&nbsp;56.</a></span></span></span> How so? Herein, great king, a Nigaṇṭha is restrained with regard to all water; he is endowed with the avoidance of all evil; he is cleansed by the avoidance of all evil; he is suffused with the avoidance of all evil. Great king, when a Nigaṇṭha is restrained with this fourfold restraint, he is called a knotless one who is self-perfected, self-controlled, and self-established.'</p>

<p id="p32"><span class="parno">32</span>"Thus, venerable sir, when I asked Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta about a visible fruit of recluseship, he explained to me the fourfold restraint.

<h4>The Doctrine of Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta</h4>

<p id="p33"><span class="parno">33</span>"Another time, venerable sir, I approached Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta, exchanged greetings and courtesies with him, and sat down to one side. I then asked him (<i>as in</i> §16) if he could point out any fruit of recluseship visible here and now.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p34"><span class="parno">34</span>"When I had finished speaking, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta said to me: 'If you ask me:</p>

<p>"Is there a world beyond?" If I thought that there is a world beyond, I would declare to you "There is a world beyond." But I do not say "It is this way," nor "It is that way," nor "It is otherwise." I do not say "It is not so," nor do I say "It is not not so."</p>

<p>'Similarly, you might ask me the following questions:
<br>"Is there no world beyond?"
<br>"Is it that there both is and is not a world beyond?"
<br>"Is it that there neither is nor is not a world beyond?"</p>

<p>"Are there beings who have taken rebirth?"
<br>"Are there no beings who have taken rebirth?"
<br>"Is it that there both are and are not beings who have taken rebirth?"
<br>"Is it that there neither are nor are not beings who have taken rebirth?"</p>

<p>"Is there fruit and result of good and bad actions?"
<br>"Is there no fruit and result of good and bad actions?"
<br>"Is it that there both are and are not fruit and result of good and bad actions?"
<br>"Is it that there neither are nor are not fruit and result of good and bad actions?"</p>

<p>"Does the Tathāgata exist after death?"
<br>"Does the Tathāgata not exist after death?"
<br>"Does the Tathāgata both exist and not exist after death?"
<br>"Does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death?"</p>

<p>'If I thought that it was so, I would declare to you "It is so." But do I not say "It is this way," nor "It is that way," nor "It is otherwise." I do not say "It is not so," nor do I say "It is not not so."'</p>

<h3>Fruits of Recluseship</h3>
<h4>The First Visible Fruit of Recluseship</h4>

<p id="p36"><span class="parno">36</span>"So, venerable sir, I ask the Exalted One: There are, venerable sir, various crafts, such as elephant trainers, horse trainers, charioteers, archers, standard bearers, camp marshals, commandos, high royal officers, front-line soldiers, bull-warriors, military heroes, mail-clad warriors, domestic slaves, confectioners, barbers, bath attendants, cooks, garland-makers, laundrymen, weavers, basket-makers, potters, statisticians, accountants, and various other crafts of a similar nature. All those (who practise these crafts) enjoy here and now the visible fruits of their craft. They obtain happiness and joy themselves, and they give happiness and joy to their parents, their wives and children, their friends and colleagues. They establish an excellent presentation of gifts to recluses and brahmins—leading to heaven, ripening in happiness, conducing to a heavenly rebirth. Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out any fruit of recluseship that is similarly visible here and now?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p37"><span class="parno">37</span>"It is, great king. But let me question you about this matter. Answer as you think fit.</p>

<p>"What do you think, great king? Suppose you have a slave, a workman who rises up before you, retires after you, does whatever you want, acts always for your pleasure, speaks politely to you, and is ever on the lookout to see that you are satisfied. The thought might occur to him: 'It is wonderful and marvellous, the destiny and result of meritorious deeds.<span class="note" id="n116"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.116] Meritorious deeds (<i>puñña</i>) do not lead to enlightenment, but to (temporary) future happiness in this world or another. This is the usual aim of ‘popular’ Buddhism.</span></span></span> For this King Ajātasattu is a human being, and I too am a human being, yet King Ajātasattu enjoys himself fully endowed and supplied with the five strands of sense pleasure as if he were a god, while I am his slave, his workman—rising before him, retiring after him, doing whatever he wants, acting always for his pleasure, speaking politely to him, ever on the lookout to see that he is satisfied. I could be like him if I were to do meritorious deeds. Let me then shave off my hair and beard, put on saffron robes, and go forth from home to homelessness.'</p>

<p id="p38"><span class="parno">38</span>"After some time he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on saffron robes, and goes forth from home to homelessness. Having gone forth he dwells restrained in body, speech, and mind, content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude. Suppose your men were to report all this to you. Would you say: 'Bring that man back to me, men. Let him again become my slave, my workman, rising before me, retiring after me, doing whatever I want, acting always for my pleasure, speaking politely to me, ever on the lookout to see that I am satisfied.'?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p39"><span class="parno">39</span>"Certainly not, venerable sir. Rather, we would pay homage to him, rise up out of respect for him, invite him to a seat, and invite him to accept from us robes, almsfood, dwelling and medicinal requirements. And we would provide him righteous protection, defence, and security."</p>

<p id="p40"><span class="parno">40</span>"What do you think, great king? If such is the case, is there or is there not a visible fruit of recluseship?"</p>

<p>"There certainly is, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"This, great king, is the first fruit of recluseship, visible here and now, that I point out to you."</p>

<h4>The Second Visible Fruit of Recluseship</h4>

<p id="p41"><span class="parno">41</span>"Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out some other fruit of recluseship visible here and now?"</p>

<p>"It is, great king. But let me question you about this matter. Answer as you think fit.</p>

<p>"What do you think, great king? Suppose there is a farmer, a householder, who pays taxes to maintain the royal revenue. The thought might occur to him: 'It is wonderful and marvellous, the destiny and result of meritorious deeds. For this King Ajātasattu is a human being, and I too am a human being. Yet King Ajātasattu enjoys himself fully endowed and supplied with the five strands of sense pleasure as if he were a god, while I am a farmer, a householder, who pays taxes to maintain the royal revenue. I could be like him if I were to do meritorious deeds. Let me then shave off my hair and beard, put on saffron robes, and go forth from home to homelessness.'</p>

<p id="p42"><span class="parno">42</span>"After some time, he abandons his accumulation of wealth, be it large or small, abandons his circle of relatives, be it large or small; he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on saffron robes, and goes forth from home to homelessness. Having gone forth, he dwells restrained in body, speech, and mind, content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude. Suppose your men were to report all this to you. Would you say: 'Bring that man back to me, men. Let him again become a farmer, a householder, who pays taxes to maintain the royal revenue'?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p43"><span class="parno">43</span>"Certainly not, venerable sir. Rather, we would pay homage to him, rise up out of respect for him, invite him to a seat, and invite him to accept from us robes, almsfood, dwelling, and medicinal requirements. And we would provide him with righteous protection, defence, and security."</p>

<p id="p44"><span class="parno">44</span>"What do you think, great king? If such is the case, is there or is there not a visible fruit of recluseship?"</p>

<p>"There certainly is, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"This, great king, is the second fruit of recluseship, visible here and now, that I point out to you."</p>

<h4>The More Excellent Fruits of Recluseship</h4>

<p id="p45"><span class="parno">45</span>"Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out any other fruit of recluseship visible here and now, more excellent and sublime than these two fruits?"</p>

<p>"It is possible. Listen, great king, and attend carefully, I will speak."</p>

<p>"Yes, venerable sir," King Ajātasattu replied to the Exalted One.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p46"><span class="parno">46</span>The Exalted One spoke: "Herein, great king, a Tathāgata arises in the world, a worthy one, perfectly enlightened, endowed with clear knowledge and conduct, accomplished, a knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of men to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and exalted. Having realized by his own direct knowledge this world with its gods, its Māras,<span class="note" id="n117"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.117] Māra, the personified tempter like the Biblical Satan (he appears in person in <a href="dn16.html">DN 16</a>). Both Māra and Brahmā are subject to rebirth, and their ‘office’ is taken over by other beings according to their kamma.</span></span></span> and its Brahmās, this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its rulers<span class="note" id="n118"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.118] <i>Deva</i> again, this time in the sense of ‘devas by convention’, i.e. kings.</span></span></span> and people, he makes it known to others. He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, possessing meaning and phrasing; he reveals the holy life that is fully complete and purified.</p>

<p id="p47"><span class="parno">47</span>"A householder, or a householder's son, or one born into some other family, hears the Dhamma. Having heard the Dhamma, he gains faith in the Tathāgata. Endowed with such faith, he reflects: 'The household life is crowded, a path of dust. Going forth is like the open air. It is not easy for one dwelling at home to lead the perfectly complete, perfectly purified holy life, bright as a polished conch. Let me then shave off my hair and beard, put on saffron robes, and go forth from home to homelessness.'</p>

<p id="p48"><span class="parno">48</span>"After some time he abandons his accumulation of wealth, be it large or small; he abandons his circle of relatives, be it large or small; he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on saffron robes, and goes forth from home to homelessness.</p>

<p id="p49"><span class="parno">49</span>"When he has thus gone forth, he lives restrained by the restraint of the Pāṭimokkha, possessed of proper behaviour and resort. Having taken up the rules of training, he trains himself in them, seeing danger in the slightest faults. He comes to be endowed with wholesome bodily and verbal action, his livelihood is purified, and he is possessed of moral discipline. He guards the doors of his sense faculties, is endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension, and is content.</p>

<p id="p50"><span class="parno">50</span>"And how, great king, is the bhikkhu possessed of moral discipline?

<p id="p55"><span class="parno">55</span>"Having abandoned harsh speech, he abstains from harsh speech. He speaks only such words as are gentle, pleasing to the ear, endearing, going to the heart, polite, amiable and agreeable to the manyfolk. This too pertains to his moral discipline.</p>

<p id="p56"><span class="parno">56</span>"Having abandoned idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter. He speaks at the right time, speaks what is factual and beneficial, speaks on the Dhamma and the Discipline.

Endowed with this noble aggregate of moral discipline, he experiences within himself a blameless happiness. In this way, great king, the bhikkhu is possessed of moral discipline.</p>

<h5>Concentration</h5>
<h6>Restraint of the Sense Faculties</h6>

<p id="p76"><span class="parno">76</span>"And how, great king, does the bhikkhu guard the doors of his sense faculties? Herein, great king, having seen a form with the eye, the bhikkhu does not grasp at the sign or the details. Since, if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye, evil unwholesome states such as covetousness and grief might assail him, he practises restraint, guards the faculty of the eye, and achieves restraint over the faculty of the eye. Having heard a sound with the ear … having smelled an odour with the nose … having tasted a flavour with the tongue … having touched a tangible object with the body … having cognized a mind-object with the mind, the bhikkhu does not grasp at the sign or the details. Since, if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the mind, evil unwholesome states such as covetousness and grief might assail him, he practises restraint, guards the faculty of the mind, and achieves restraint over the faculty of the mind. Endowed with this noble restraint of the sense faculties, he experiences within himself an unblemished happiness. In this way, great king, the bhikkhu guards the doors of the sense faculties.</p>

<h6>Mindfulness and Clear Comprehension</h6>

<p id="p77"><span class="parno">77</span>"And how, great king, is the bhikkhu endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension? Herein, great king, in going forward and returning, the bhikkhu acts with clear comprehension. In looking ahead and looking aside, he acts with clear comprehension. In bending and stretching the limbs, he acts with clear comprehension. In wearing his robes and cloak and using his alms-bowl, he acts with clear comprehension. In eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting, he acts with clear comprehension. In defecating and urinating, he acts with clear comprehension. In going, standing, sitting, lying down, waking up, speaking, and remaining silent, he acts with clear comprehension. In this way, great king, the bhikkhu is endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension.</p>

<h6 id="ment">Contentment</h6>

<p id="p78"><span class="parno">78</span>"And how, great king, is the bhikkhu content? Herein, great king, a bhikkhu is content with robes to protect his body and almsfood to sustain his belly; wherever he goes he sets out taking only (his requisites) along with him. Just as a bird, wherever it goes, flies with its wings as its only burden, in the same way a bhikkhu is content with robes to protect his body and almsfood to sustain his belly; wherever he goes he sets out taking only (his requisites) along with him. In this way, great king, the bhikkhu is content.</p>

<h6>The Abandoning of the Hindrances</h6>

<p id="p79"><span class="parno">79</span>"Endowed with this noble aggregate of moral discipline, this noble restraint over the sense faculties, this noble mindfulness and clear comprehension, and this noble contentment, he resorts to a secluded dwelling— a forest, the foot of a tree, a mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a cremation ground, a jungle grove, the open air, a heap of straw. After returning from his alms-round, following his meals, he sits down, crosses his legs, holds his body erect, and sets up mindfulness before him.<span class="note" id="n119"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.119] <i>Parimukhatiṁ satiṁ upaṭṭhapetvā:</i> probably means ‘having firmly established mindfulness’. See <a href="dn22.html#637">n.637.</a></span></span></span></p>

<p id="p80"><span class="parno">80</span>"Having abandoned covetousness for the world, he dwells with a mind free from covetousness; he purifies his mind from covetousness. Having abandoned ill will and hatred, he dwells with a benevolent mind, sympathetic for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Having abandoned dullness and drowsiness, he dwells perceiving light,<span class="note" id="n120"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.120] Cultivation of the perception of light is given as a standard way of overcoming the hindrance of sloth-and-torpor (<i>thīna-midha</i>). See VM 1.140.</span></span></span> mindful and clearly comprehending; he purifies his mind from dullness and drowsiness. Having abandoned restlessness and worry, he dwells at ease within himself, with a peaceful mind; he purifies his mind from restlessness and worry. Having abandoned doubt, he dwells as one who has passed beyond doubt, unperplexed about wholesome states; he purifies his mind from doubt.</p>

<p id="p81"><span class="parno">81</span>"Great king, suppose a man were to take a loan and apply it to his business, and his business were to succeed, so that he could pay back his old debts and would have enough money left over to maintain a wife. He would reflect on this, and as a result he would become glad and experience joy.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p82"><span class="parno">82</span>"Again, great king, suppose a man were to become sick, afflicted, gravely ill, so that he could not enjoy his food and his strength would decline. After some time he would recover from that illness and would enjoy his food and regain his bodily strength. He would reflect on this, and as a result he would become glad and experience joy.</p>

<p id="p83"><span class="parno">83</span>"Again, great king, suppose a man were locked up in a prison. After some time he would be released from prison, safe and secure, with no loss of his possessions. He would reflect on this, and as a result he would become glad and experience joy.</p>

<p id="p84"><span class="parno">84</span>"Again, great king, suppose a man were a slave, without independence, subservient to others, unable to go where he wants. After some time he would be released from slavery and gain his independence; he would no longer be subservient to others but a free man able to go where he wants. He would reflect on this, and as a result he would become glad and experience joy.</p>

<p id="p85"><span class="parno">85</span>"Again, great king, suppose a man with wealth and possessions were travelling along a desert road where food was scarce and dangers were many. After some time he would cross over the desert and arrive safely at a village which is safe and free from danger. He would reflect on this, and as a result he would become glad and experience joy.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p86"><span class="parno">86</span>"In the same way, great king, when a bhikkhu sees that these five hindrances are unabandoned<span class="note" id="n121"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.121] The five hindrances are temporarily dispelled by the jhāna states.</span></span></span> within himself, he regards that as a debt, as a sickness, as confinement in prison, as slavery, as a desert road.</p>

<p id="p87"><span class="parno">87</span>"But when he sees that these five hindrances have been abandoned within himself, he regards that as freedom from debt, as good health, as release from prison, as freedom from slavery, as a place of safety.</p>

<p id="p88"><span class="parno">88</span>"When he sees that these five hindrances have been abandoned within himself, gladness arises. When he is gladdened, rapture arises. When his mind is filled with rapture, his body becomes tranquil; tranquil in body, he experiences happiness; being happy, his mind becomes concentrated.</p>

<h6>The First Jhāna</h6>

<p id="p89"><span class="parno">89</span>"Quite secluded from sense pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought and filled with the rapture and happiness born of seclusion. He drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses his body with this rapture and happiness born of seclusion, so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this rapture and happiness.</p>

<p id="p90"><span class="parno">90</span>"Great king, suppose a skilled bath attendant or his apprentice were to pour soap-powder into a metal basin, sprinkle it with water, and knead it into a ball, so that the ball of soap-powder be pervaded by moisture, encompassed by moisture, suffused with moisture inside and out, yet would not trickle. In the same way, great king, the bhikkhu drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses his body with the rapture and happiness born of seclusion, so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this rapture and happiness. This, great king, is a visible fruit of recluseship more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.<span class="note" id="n122"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.122] This concludes the Buddha’s answer to the first part of the question posed in verse <a href="#p41">41.</a></span></span></span></p>

<h6>The Second Jhāna</h6>

<p id="p91"><span class="parno">91</span>"Further, great king, with the subsiding of applied and sustained thought, the bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which is accompanied by internal confidence and unification of mind, is without applied and sustained thought, and is filled with the rapture and happiness born of concentration. He drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses his body with this rapture and happiness born of concentration, so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this rapture and happiness.</p>

<p id="p92"><span class="parno">92</span>"Great king, suppose there were a deep lake whose waters welled up from below. It would have no inlet for water from the east, west, north, or south, nor would it be refilled from time to time with showers of rain; yet a current of cool water, welling up from within the lake, would drench, steep, saturate and suffuse the whole lake, so that there would be no part of that entire lake which is not suffused with the cool water. In the same way, great king, the bhikkhu drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses his body with the rapture and happiness born of concentration, so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this rapture and happiness. This too, great king, is a visible fruit of recluseship more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.</p>

<h6>The Third Jhāna</h6>

<p id="p93"><span class="parno">93</span>"Further, great king, with the fading away of rapture, the bhikkhu dwells in equanimity, mindful and clearly comprehending, and experiences happiness with the body. Thus he enters and dwells in the third jhāna, of which the noble ones declare: 'He dwells happily with equanimity and mindfulness.' He drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses his body with this happiness free from rapture, so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this happiness.</p>

<p id="p94"><span class="parno">94</span>"Great king, suppose in a lotus pond there were blue, white, or red lotuses<span class="note" id="n123"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.123] <i>Uppala</i> (Skt. <i>utpala</i>), paduma (Skt. <i>padma</i>), <i>puṇḍarīka</i> are different kinds of lotus, usually of the colour mentioned.</span></span></span> that have been born in the water, grow in the water, and never rise up above the water, but flourish immersed in the water. From their tips to their roots they would be drenched, steeped, saturated, and suffused with cool water, so that there would be no part of those lotuses not suffused with cool water. In the same way, great king, the bhikkhu drenches, steeps, saturates and suffuses his body with the happiness free from rapture, so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this happiness. This too, great king, is a visible fruit of recluseship more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.</p>

<h3>The Fourth Jhāna</h3>

<p id="p95"><span class="parno">95</span>"Further, great king, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and grief, the bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is neither pleasant nor painful and contains mindfulness fully purified by equanimity. He sits suffusing his body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his entire body not suffused by a pure bright mind.</p>

<p id="p96"><span class="parno">96</span>"Great king, suppose a man were to be sitting covered from the head down by a white cloth, so that there would be no part of his entire body not suffused by the white cloth. In the same way, great king, the bhikkhu sits suffusing his body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his entire body not suffused by a pure bright mind. This too, great king, is a visible fruit of recluseship more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.</p>

<h5>Eight Insights</h5>
<h6 id="4know">Insight Knowledge</h6>

<p id="p97"><span class="parno">97</span>"When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects,<span class="note" id="n124"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.124] <i>Upakilesa:</i> to be distinguished from <i>kilesa</i> ‘defilement’.

He understands thus: 'This is my body, having material form, composed of the four primary elements, originating from father and mother, built up out of rice and gruel, impermanent, subject to rubbing and pressing, to dissolution and dispersion. And this is my consciousness, supported by it and bound up with it.'<span class="note" id="n125"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.125] RD points out that this and other passages disprove the idea that consciousness (<i>viññāṇa</i>) transmigrates. For holding this belief Sāti was severely rebuked by the Buddha (<a href="../mn/mn38.html">MN&nbsp;38</a>). A new relinking consciousness (<i>patisandhi</i>) arises at conception, dependent on the old (see VM 17.164ff.).</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p98"><span class="parno">98</span>"Great king, suppose there were a beautiful beryl<span class="note" id="n126"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.126] <i>Veḷuriya:</i> from a metathetised form <i>veruliya</i> comes Greek <i>beryllos</i> ‘beryl’, whence German <i>Brille</i> ‘spectacles’ (originally of beryl).</span></span></span> gem of purest water, eight-faceted, well cut, clear, limpid, flawless, endowed with all excellent qualities. And through it there would run a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread. A man with keen sight, taking it in his hand, would reflect upon it thus: 'This is a beautiful beryl gem of purest water, eight faceted, well cut, clear, limpid, flawless, endowed with all excellent qualities. And running through it there is this blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread.' In the same way, great king, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright … the bhikkhu directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision and understands thus: 'This is my body, having material form … . and this is my consciousness, supported by it and bound up with it.' This, too, great king, is a visible fruit of recluseship more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.</p>

<h6>The Knowledge of the Mind-made Body</h6>

<p id="p99"><span class="parno">99</span>"When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body.

<p id="p100"><span class="parno">100</span>"Great king, suppose a man were to draw out a reed from its sheath. He would think: 'This is the reed; this is the sheath. The reed is one thing, the sheath another, but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath.' Or suppose a man were to draw a sword out from its scabbard. He would think: 'This is the sword; this is the scabbard. The sword is one thing, the scabbard another, but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.' Or suppose a man were to pull a snake out from its slough. He would think: 'This is the snake; this is the slough. The snake is one thing, the slough another, but the snake has been pulled out from the slough.' In the same way, great king, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright … The bhikkhu directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another body having material form, mind-made, complete in all its parts, not lacking any faculties. This too, great king, is a visible fruit of recluseship more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.</p>

<h6>The Knowledge of the Modes of Supernormal Power</h6>

<p id="p101"><span class="parno">101</span>"When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the modes of supernormal power.<span class="note" id="n128"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.128] <i>Iddhi</i> (Skt. <i>ṛddhi</i>, not, as often stated, <i>siddhi</i>): translated by RD as ‘The Wondrous Gift’ and glossed as ‘well-being, prosperity’.

But despite his mention of them here, the Buddha disapproved of these practices (see <a href="dn11.html#p5">DN 11.5</a>).</span></span></span> He exercises the various modes of supernormal power: having been one, he becomes many and having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space; he dives in and out of the earth as if it were water; he walks on water without sinking as if it were earth; sitting cross-legged he travels through space like a winged bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the sun and the moon, so mighty and powerful;<span class="note" id="n129"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.129] DA has no useful comment on this, and modem commentators too are silent, but ‘touching the sun and moon’ probably refers to some psychic experience.

<h6>The Knowledge of the Divine Ear</h6>

<p id="p103"><span class="parno">103</span>"When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the divine ear-element.<span class="note" id="n130"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.130] <i>Dibba-sota:</i> clairaudience (cf. <a href="dn1.html#n72">n.72</a>).</span></span></span> With the divine ear-element, which is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sound, the divine and the human, those which are distant and those which are near.</p>

<p id="p106"><span class="parno">106</span>"Great king, suppose a young man or woman, fond of ornaments, examining his or her own facial reflection in a pure bright mirror or in a bowl of clear water, would know, if there were a mole, 'It has a mole,' and if there were no mole, 'It has no mole.' In the same way, great king, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright … the bhikkhu directs and inclines it to the knowledge of encompassing the minds (of others). He understands the minds of other beings and persons, having encompassed them with his own mind. This too, great king, is a visible fruit of recluseship more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.</p>

<h6>The Knowledge of Recollecting Past Lives</h6>

<p id="p107"><span class="parno">107</span>"When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of recollecting past lives. He recollects his numerous past lives, that is, one birth, two births, three, four, or five births; ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty births; a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births; many aeons of world contraction, many aeons of world expansion, many aeons of world contraction and expansion, (recollecting): 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my span of life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my span of life. Passing away from that state I re-arose here.' Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their details.</p>

<p id="p108"><span class="parno">108</span>"Great king, suppose a man were to go from his own village to another village, then from that village to still another village, and then from that village he would return to his own village. He would think to himself: 'I went from my own village to that village. There I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, spoke in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I went to still another village. There too I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, spoke in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I returned to my own village.'<span class="note" id="n132"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.132] The three villages are the three worlds of Sense-Desire, of Form, and the Formless World (DA).</span></span></span> In the same way, great king, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright … the bhikkhu directs and inclines it to the knowledge of recollecting past lives, and he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their details. This too, great king, is a visible fruit of recluseship, more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.</p>

<h6>The Knowledge of the Divine Eye</h6>

<p id="p109"><span class="parno">109</span>"When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings. With the divine eye,<span class="note" id="n133"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.133] <i>Dibba-cakkhu:</i> clairvoyance, not to be confused with the Dhamma-eye (<a href="#p109">verse 109</a>).

</span></span></span> which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate—and he understands how beings fare according to their kamma, thus: 'These beings—who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views, and undertook actions governed by wrong views—with the breakup of the body, after death, have reappeared in the plane of misery, the bad destinations, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings—who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, held right views, and undertook actions governed by right views—with the breakup of the body, after death, have reappeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate—and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma.</p>

<p id="p110"><span class="parno">110</span>"Great king, suppose in a central square there were a building with an upper terrace, and a man with keen sight standing there were to see people entering a house, leaving it, walking along the streets, and sitting in the central square. He would think to himself: 'Those people are entering the house, those are leaving it, those are walking along the streets, and those are sitting in the central square.' In the same way, great king, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright … the bhikkhu directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings. With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing, and he understands how beings fare according to their kamma. This too, great king, is a visible fruit of recluseship more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.</p>

<h6>The Knowledge of the Destruction of the Cankers</h6>

<p id="111"><span class="parno">111</span>"When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers.<span class="note" id="n134"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.134] <i>Āsavā:</i> from <i>ā-savati</i> ‘flows towards’ (i.e. either ‘into’, or ‘out’ towards the observer). Variously translated ‘biases’, ‘intoxicants’, ‘influxes’, ‘cankers’ or ‘Deadly Taints’ (RD). A further corruption, that of wrong views (<i>diṭṭhāsava</i>) is sometimes added. The destruction of the āsavas is equivalent to Arahantship.</span></span></span> He understands as it really is: 'This is suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the origin of suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the cessation of suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' He understands as it really is: 'These are the cankers.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the origin of the cankers.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the cessation of the cankers.' He understands as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of the cankers.'</p>

<p>"Knowing and seeing thus, his mind is liberated from the canker of sensual desire, from the canker of existence, and from the canker of ignorance. When it is liberated, the knowledge arises: 'It is liberated.' He understands: 'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further beyond this.'<span class="note" id="n135"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.135] <i>Nâparaṁ itthatāya:</i> lit. ‘there is no more of “thusness”’.

<p id="p112"><span class="parno">112</span>"Great king, suppose in a mountain glen there were a lake with clear water, limpid and unsullied. A man with keen sight, standing on the bank, would see oyster-shells, sand and pebbles, and shoals of fish moving about and keeping still. He would think to himself: 'This is a lake with clear water, limpid and unsullied, and there within it are oyster-shells, sand and pebbles, and shoals of fish moving about and keeping still.'</p>

<p>"In the same way, great king, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright … . the bhikkhu directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers.

This too, great king, is a visible fruit of recluseship more excellent and sublime than the previous ones. And, great king, there is no other fruit of recluseship higher or more sublime than this one."<span class="note" id="n136"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.136] All the preceding ‘fruits’ have led up to this, which alone, as RD points out, is exclusively Buddhist. There are 13 items or groups, and the list, in whole or with some omissions, recurs in every Sutta of Division 1. Summarised, they are: 1. The respect shown to a member of a religious order; 2. The training in morality as in DN 1; 3. Confidence felt as a result of right action; 4. The habit of guarding the sense-doors; 5. Resulting mindfulness and clear awareness; 6. Being content with little; 7. Freedom from the five hindrances; Resulting joy and peace; 9. The four jhānas; 10. Knowledge born of insight; 11. The production of mental images; 12.

The realisation of the Four Noble Truths, the destruction of the corruptions (= the sixth, supramundane, abhiññā), and the attainment of Arahantship.</span></span></span></p>

<h3>King Ajātasattu Declares Himself a Lay Follower</h3>

<p id="p113"><span class="parno">113</span>When the Exalted One had finished speaking, King Ajātasattu said to him: "Excellent, venerable sir! Excellent, venerable sir! Just as if one were to turn upright what had been turned upside down, or to reveal what was hidden, or to point out the right path to one who was lost, or to bring a lamp into a dark place so that those with keen sight could see forms, in the same way, venerable sir, the Exalted One has revealed the Dhamma in numerous ways. I go for refuge to the Exalted One, to the Dhamma, and to the Bhikkhu Saṅgha. Let the Exalted One accept me as a lay follower gone for refuge from this day onwards as long as I live.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p114"><span class="parno">114</span>"Venerable sir, a transgression<span class="note" id="n137"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.137] <i>Accayo:</i> often rendered (as by RD) ‘sin’, but this term with its theistic connotations is best avoided when translating Buddhist texts.</span></span></span> overcame me. I was so foolish, so deluded, so unskilful that for the sake of rulership I took the life of my own father, a righteous man and a righteous king. Let the Exalted One acknowledge my transgression as a transgression for the sake of my restraint in the future."<span class="note" id="n138"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.138] This is the formula used by bhikkhus when confessing transgressions.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Indeed, great king, a transgression overcame you. You were so foolish, so deluded, so unskilful that for the sake of rulership you took the life of your father, a righteous man and a righteous king. But since you have seen your transgression as a transgression and make amends for it according to the Dhamma, we acknowledge it. For, great king, this is growth in the discipline of the Noble One: that a person sees his transgression as a transgression, makes amends for it according to the Dhamma, and achieves restraint in the future."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p115"><span class="parno">115</span>When this was said, King Ajātasattu said to the Exalted One: "Now, venerable sir, we must go. We have many tasks and duties."</p>

<p>"Do whatever seems fit, great king."</p>

<p>Then King Ajātasattu rejoiced in the word of the Exalted One and thanked him for it. Rising from his seat, he paid homage to the Exalted One, circumambulated him, and departed.</p>

<p id="p116"><span class="parno">116</span>Soon after King Ajātasattu had left, the Exalted One addressed the bhikkhus: "This king, bhikkhus, has ruined himself; he has injured himself.<span class="note" id="n139"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.139] <i>Khatâyaṁ bhikkhave rājā, upahatâyaṁ bhikkhave rājā.</i> RD went astray with his translation here: ‘This king, brethren, was deeply affected, he was touched in heart.’ Lit. ‘uprooted and destroyed’, the expression indicates that Ajātasattu was inhibited by his kamma from obtaining the results that would otherwise have accrued, since parricide is one of the evil acts ‘with immediate result’ (in the next world) that cannot be avoided. According to DA, he was unable to sleep until his visit to the Buddha.</span></span></span> Bhikkhus, if this king had not taken the life of his father, a righteous man and a righteous king, then in this very seat there would have arisen in him the dust-free, stainless eye of Dhamma."<span class="note" id="n140"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.140] The opening of the Dhamma-eye (<i>dhamma-cakkhu</i>) is a term for ‘entering the stream’ and thus being set irrevocably on the path. As RD points out, it is superior to the divine eye (<i>dibba-cakkhu:</i> <a href="#p109">verse 109</a> and <a href="#n.133">n.133</a>), which is a superior kind of clairvoyance, and below the wisdom-eye (<i>paññā-cakkhu</i>), which is the wisdom of the Arahant.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p117"><span class="parno">117</span>Thus spoke the Exalted One. Elated in mind, the bhikkhus rejoiced in the Exalted One's word.</p>
