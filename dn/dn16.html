<h3>King Ajātasattu</h3>

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus I heard:<span class="note" id="n363"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.363] With this Sutta, Mrs Bennett’s volume of abridged translations comes to an end. Of greater value was <i>The Last Days of the Buddha,</i> translated by Sister Vajirā and revised by Francis Story, with notes by the Ven. Nyānaponika Mahāthera (<a href="http://www.bps.lk/library-search-select.php?id=wh067">Wheel Publication 67/69</a>, BPS, Kandy 1964).

<br class="half">The Sutta is a composite one, many portions of which are found separately in other parts of the Canon, as listed by RD. No doubt it contains the basic facts about the Buddha’s last days, but various late and more than dubious elements have been incorporated in it-a process which continued in the later Sanskrit versions (produced by the Sarvāstivādins and other schools), which are known to us mainly from the Chinese and Tibetan translations (though some Sanskrit fragments have been found). For E. Waldschmidt’s (German) study of these, see A.K. Warder, <i>Indian Buddhism</i> (2nd ed., Delhi 1980). The Tibetan version is translated into English in W.W. Rockhill, <i>Life of the Buddha</i> (2nd ed., London 1907), pp. 123–147. It should perhaps be mentioned that the (expanded, Sanskrit-based) Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra is sometimes cited as evidence for the belief in a supreme self in Mahayana Buddhism. One Chinese version does indeed contain a passage to this effect, but this is a late interpolation, and is not representative of the general Mahayana position.</span></span></span>— At one time the Gracious One was living near Rājagaha on the Vultures' Peak Mountain.<span class="note" id="n364"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.364] Gijjhakūṭa: a pleasant elevation above the stifling heat of Rajagaha. The name was taken up by Mahayana writers, who often located the Buddha’s discourses there.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Now at that time the Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom,<span class="note" id="n365"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.365] See also <a href="dn2.html#n92">n.92.</a> He is certainly a historical figure, unlike the ‘King Ajātaśatru of Benares’ of the Bṛhadāranyaka Upaniṣad, with whom he shared a taste for philosophical discussion with sages. RD points out that this is not his personal name but an official epithet. The literal meaning ‘unborn foe’ must then mean ‘he against whom a foe (capable of conquering him) has not been born’, though in view of his act of parricide it came to be taken as ‘the unborn foe (i.e. while still in the womb) of his father’- with legendary elaboration. In Jain sources he is called Kuṇika or Konika. Vedehiputta means ‘son of the Videha woman’ (see next note). There is a long article on him in EB, where, however, RD’s mistranslation at DN <a href="dn2.html#p.102">2.102</a> (see&nbsp;n.139 there) is repeated.</span></span></span> had a desire to attack the Vajjians. He said this: "I will annihilate these Vajjians,<span class="note" id="n366"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.366] The Vajjian confederacy, northward across the Ganges from Magadha, consisted of the Licchavis of Vesālī and the Vedehis (of Videha — to whom Ajatasattu’s mother belonged), whose capital was Mithila.</span></span></span> who are so successful, so powerful, I will destroy the Vajjians, I will bring about the downfall and destruction of the Vajjians".</p>

<p id="2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then the Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, addressed the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra, saying:</p>

<p>"Go, brahmin, and approach the Gracious One, and after approaching worship the Gracious One's feet in my name, and ask whether he is free from sickness, free from illness, in good health, and living comfortably, and say: 'The Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, reverend Sir, worships with his head at the Gracious One's feet, and asks whether you are free from sickness, free from illness, in good health, and living comfortably.'</p>

<p>And say this: 'The Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, reverend Sir, desires to attack the Vajjians. He says this: "I will annihilate these Vajjians, who are so successful, so powerful, I will destroy the Vajjians, I will bring about the downfall and destruction of the Vajjians." And just what the Gracious One says to you, after learning it well, you must inform me, for the Realised Ones do not speak falsely."</p>

<h3>1. The Brāhman Vassakāra</h3>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"Very well, dear Sir," and the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra, after replying to the Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, and having many great and august vehicles prepared, and mounting those great and august vehicles, departed with those great and august vehicles from Rājagaha, and after approaching by vehicle to the Vultures' Peak Mountain as far as the ground for vehicles would allow, and descending from the vehicles, he approached the Gracious One by foot, and after approaching, he exchanged greetings with the Gracious One, and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings, he sat down on one side. While sitting on one side, the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra said this to the Gracious One:</p>

<p>"The Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, dear Gotama, worships with his head at dear Gotama's feet, and asks whether you are free from sickness, free from illness, in good health, and living comfortably.</p>

<p>The Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, dear Gotama, desires to attack the Vajjians. He says this: 'I will annihilate these Vajjians, who are so successful, so powerful, I will destroy the Vajjians, I will bring about the downfall and destruction of the Vajjians'".</p>

<h3>2: Seven Things which Prevent Decline in the Vajjians</h3>

<p id="4"><span class="parno">4</span>Now at that time venerable Ānanda was stood behind the Gracious One fanning the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying:</p>

<p>"Have you heard, Ānanda: 'The Vajjians assemble regularly and assemble frequently?'" "I have heard this, reverend Sir: 'The Vajjians assemble regularly and assemble frequently.'" "For as long, Ānanda, as the Vajjians will assemble regularly and assemble frequently surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline. (1)</p>

<p>Have you heard, Ānanda: 'The Vajjians assemble unanimously, rise unanimously, and carry out their Vajjian duties unanimously?'" "I have heard this, reverend Sir, that the Vajjians assemble unanimously, rise unanimously, and carry out their Vajjian duties unanimously." "For as long, Ānanda, as the Vajjians will assemble unanimously, rise unanimously, and carry out their Vajjian duties unanimously, surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline. (2)</p>

<p>Have you heard, Ānanda: 'The Vajjians do not establish new laws that were not established, or cut off old laws that were established, and carry on with such laws as were accepted in the Ancient Vajjian Constitution?'" "I have heard this, reverend Sir: 'The Vajjians do not establish new laws that were not established, or cut off old laws that were established, and they carry on with such laws as were accepted in the Ancient Vajjian Constitution.'" "For as long, Ānanda, as the Vajjians do not establish new laws that were not established, or cut off old laws that were established, and they carry on with such laws as were accepted in the Ancient Vajjian Constitution surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline. (3)</p>

<p>Have you heard, Ānanda: 'The Vajjians honour the elders of the Vajjians, respect, revere, worship and think them worth listening to?'" "I have heard this, reverend Sir: 'The Vajjians honour the elders of the Vajjians, respect, revere, worship and think them worth listening to.'" "For as long, Ānanda, as the Vajjians will honour the elders of the Vajjians, respect, revere, worship and think them worth listening to, surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline. (4)</p>

<p>Have you heard, Ānanda: 'The Vajjians do not coerce and force their women and girls to dwell with them against their will?'" "I have heard this, reverend Sir: 'The Vajjians do not coerce and force their women and girls to dwell with them against their will.'" "For as long, Ānanda, as the Vajjians will not coerce and force their women and girls to dwell with them against their will, surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline. (5)</p>

<p>Have you heard, Ānanda: 'The Vajjians honour the Vajjian shrines amongst the Vajjians, both within and without the city, respect, revere, and worship them, and do not allow the righteous sacrifices that were formerly given, formerly made, to be neglected?'" "I have heard this, reverend Sir: 'The Vajjians honour the Vajjian shrines amongst the Vajjians, both within and without the city, respect, revere, and worship them, and do not allow the righteous sacrifices that were formerly given, formerly made, to be neglected." "For as long, Ānanda, as the Vajjians will honour the Vajjian shrines amongst the Vajjians, both within and without the city, respect, revere, and worship them, and do not allow the righteous sacrifices that were formerly given, formerly made, to be neglected surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline. (6)</p>

<p>Have you heard, Ānanda: 'The Vajjians have made good arrangements in regard to the lawful protection, safety, and guarding of the Worthy Ones, so that Worthy Ones in the future can enter the realm, and having entered the Worthy Ones can live comfortably in the realm?" "I have heard this, reverend Sir: 'The Vajjians have made good arrangements in regard to the lawful protection, safety, and guarding of the Worthy Ones, and that the Worthy Ones in the future can enter the realm, and having entered the Worthy Ones can live comfortably in the realm." "For as long, Ānanda, as the Vajjians will make good arrangements in regard to the lawful protection, safety, and guarding of the Worthy Ones, and that the Worthy Ones in the future can enter the realm, and having entered, the Worthy Ones can live comfortably in the realm, surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline."(7)</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Then the Gracious One addressed the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra, saying: "At one time, brahmin, I was living near Vesālī near to the Sārandada Shrine and there I taught the Vajjians these seven things which prevent decline. For as long, brahmin, as the Vajjians maintain these seven things which prevent decline, and the Vajjians agree with these seven things which prevent decline, surely growth, brahmin, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline."</p>

<p>After this was said, the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra addressed the Gracious One, saying: "If the Vajjians, dear Gotama, were endowed with even one or the other of these seven things which prevent decline, surely growth is to be expected not decline, what to say about having seven things which prevent decline? The Vajjians cannot be overcome, dear Gotama, by the Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, by war, but only through diplomacy,<span class="note" id="n367"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.367] <i>Upalāpana,</i> which RD says must mean ‘humbug, cajolery, diplomacy’.</span></span></span> or through the breaking of an alliance. And now, dear Gotama, we shall go, as we have many duties, and there is much which ought to be done."</p>

<p>"Now is the time, brahmin, for whatever you are thinking." Then the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra, after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of the Gracious One, rose from his seat and departed.</p>

<h3 id='seven'>3: Seven Things which Prevent Decline in the Community (1–7)</h3>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>Then the Gracious One, not long after the Magadhan chief minister, the brahmin Vassakāra, had gone, addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Go, Ānanda, and whatever monks there are living in dependence on Rājagaha, assemble them in the Attendance Hall."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One, and assembling whatever monks there were living in dependence on Rājagaha in the Attendance Hall, he approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he stood on one side. While standing on one side venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: "The Community of monks have assembled, reverend Sir, now is the time, Gracious One, for whatever you are thinking."</p>

<hr>
<p>Then the Gracious One after rising from his seat approached the Attendance Hall, and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat. While sitting the Gracious One addressed the monks, saying: "I will teach you seven things which prevent decline,<span class="note" id="n368"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.368] <i>Aparihāniyā dhammā:</i> ‘factors of non-decline’.</span></span></span> listen to it, apply your minds well, and I will speak." "Very well, reverend Sir," those monks replied to the Gracious One, and the Gracious One said this:</p>

<p>For as long, monks, as the monks with friendly actions by way of speech … mind will serve their fellow celibates, both in public and in private, surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline. (2–3)</p>

(4)</p>

<hr>
<p>For as long, monks, as the monks are endowed with those virtues which are unbroken, faultless, unspotted, unblemished, productive of freedom, praised by the wise, not clung to, leading to concentration, and will live endowed with virtue amongst their fellow celibates who themselves possess such virtue, both in public and in private, surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>There also the Gracious One, while living near Rājagaha on the Vultures' Peak Mountain, spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, saying: "Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom, when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration, when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom, when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants, that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of craving for continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance."</p>

<h3>9: The Story of the Teaching at Ambalaṭṭhikā</h3>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>Then the Gracious One, after living near Rājagaha for as long as he liked, addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Come Ānanda let us approach Ambalaṭṭhikā."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Ambalaṭṭhikā. There the Gracious One lived near Ambalaṭṭhikā in the King's Rest House.<span class="note" id="n371"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.371] This is the Ambalatthika mentioned in <a href="../dn/dn1.html">DN&nbsp;1</a>, not that in <a href="../dn/dn5.html">DN&nbsp;5.1.</a></span></span></span></p>

<h3>10: Sāriputta's Lion's Roar</h3>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>Then venerable Sāriputta approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sitting on one side venerable Sāriputta said this to the Gracious One: "I have confidence, reverend Sir, in the Gracious One in this way: that neither in the past, the future, or at present is there found another ascetic or brahmin who has more deep knowledge in regard to Perfect Awakening than the Gracious One."</p>

<p>"You have spoken this great and imposing speech, Sāriputta, a definite, well-grasped, lion's roar that was roared, saying: 'I have confidence, reverend Sir, in the Gracious One in this way: that neither in the past, the future, or at present is there found another ascetic or brahmin who has more deep knowledge in regard to Perfect Awakening than the Gracious One.'</p>

<p>But have you, Sāriputta, understood those who, in past times, were Worthy and Perfect Sambuddhas, and known with your mind the minds of those Gracious Ones? Or that those Gracious Ones had such and such virtues, those Gracious Ones had such and such qualities, those Gracious Ones had such and such wisdom, those Gracious Ones had such and such lifestyles, those Gracious Ones had such and such liberations?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"No, reverend Sir."</p>

<p>"But have you, Sāriputta, understood those who, in the future times, will be Worthy and Perfect Sambuddhas, and known with your mind the minds of those Gracious Ones? Or that those Gracious Ones will have such and such virtues, those Gracious Ones will have such and such qualities, those Gracious Ones will have such and such wisdom, those Gracious Ones will have such and such lifestyles, those Gracious Ones will have such and such liberations?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"No, reverend Sir."</p>

<p>"But have you understood I, who am, at present, a Worthy and Perfect Sambuddha, and known with your mind my mind? Or that the Gracious One has such and such virtues, the Gracious One has such and such qualities, the Gracious One has such and such wisdom, the Gracious One has such and such a lifestyle, the Gracious One has such and such a liberation?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"No, reverend Sir."</p>

<p>"Here then, Sāriputta, in regard to those past, future, and present Worthy and Perfect Sambuddhas you have no full and exact knowledge with your own mind. Then how is it, Sāriputta, at present that you have spoken such a great and imposing speech, a definite, well-grasped, lion's roar that was roared, saying: 'I have confidence, reverend Sir, in the Gracious One in this way: that neither in the past, the future, or at present is there found another ascetic or brahmin who has more deep knowledge in regard to Perfect Awakening than the Gracious One'?"</p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"I do not, reverend Sir, in regard to those past, future, and present Worthy and Perfect Sambuddhas have full and exact knowledge with my own mind. However, I understand what I said is in conformity with the Teaching.<span class="note" id="n372"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.372] <i>Dhammanvaya:</i> ‘the way the Dhamma goes’; anvaya also means ‘lineage’, and RD has ‘the lineage of the faith’, which is doubly inappropriate.</span></span></span></p>

<p>It is like a King's city, reverend Sir, near the border areas, having strong foundations, strong walls and gateways, and a single door, and there is a watchman, wise, accomplished, and intelligent, warding off those unknown, and letting through those well-known. While going around the road on inspection through the whole of that city he may not see such fissures in the wall or openings in the wall that even a cat could go out through, it may be so, but he knows: 'Whatever grosser beings enter or depart from this city all of them surely enter or depart through this door.'</p>

<p>Similarly, reverend Sir, I understand it is in conformity with the Teaching, that whoever, reverend Sir, in the past times, are Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas, all those Gracious Ones, after giving up the five hindrances, have penetrated with wisdom the corruptions of the mind that make one feeble, have established their minds in the four ways of attending to mindfulness, and after developing just as it is the Seven Factors of Awakening, have awakened to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening.</p>

<p>That whoever, reverend Sir, in the future times, are Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas all those Gracious Ones, after giving up the five hindrances, and penetrating with wisdom the corruptions of the mind that make one feeble, and establishing their minds in the four ways of attending to mindfulness, and developing just as it is the Seven Factors of Awakening, will awaken to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening.</p>

<p>And the Gracious One, reverend Sir, in the present time, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha, also after giving up the five hindrances, has penetrated with wisdom the corruptions of the mind that make one feeble, has established his mind in the four ways of attending to mindfulness, and after developing just as it is the Seven Factors of Awakening, has awoken to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening."</p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>There also the Gracious One, while living near Nāḷandā in Pāvārika's Mango Wood, spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, saying:</p>

<p>"Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom, when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration, when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom, when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants, that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of craving for continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance."</p>

<h3>11: The Advantages of Virtue</h3>

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>Then the Gracious One, after living near Nāḷandā for as long as he liked, addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Come Ānanda let us approach Pāṭaligāma."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Pāṭaligāma.</p>

<p>The laymen of Pāṭaligāma heard: "The Gracious One, it seems, had reached Pāṭaligāma." Then the laymen of Pāṭaligāma approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, they sat down on one side. While sitting on one side, the laymen of Pāṭaligāma said this to the Gracious One: "May the Gracious One consent, reverend Sir, to stay in our rest house." The Gracious One consented by maintaining silence.</p>

<p>Then the laymen of Pāṭaligāma, having understood the Gracious One's consent, after rising from their seats, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, approached their rest house, and after approaching, and spreading the mats so that the rest house was spread all over, and preparing the seats, setting up the water-pot, and lighting the oil-lamp, they approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, they stood on one side. While standing on one side, the laymen of Pāṭaligāma said this to the Gracious One:</p>

<p>"The rest house is spread with mats all over, reverend Sir, the seats are prepared, the water-pot is set up, and the oil-lamp is lit, now is the time, reverend Sir, for whatever the Gracious One is thinking."</p>

<hr>
<p>Then the Gracious One, having dressed in the evening time, after picking up his bowl and robe, together with the Community of monks, approached the rest house, and after approaching, washing his feet, and entering the rest house, he sat down near to the middle pillar, facing the East, and the Community of monks, after washing their feet, and entering the rest house, sat down behind the Gracious One near the West wall, facing the East, having the Gracious One in front of them. Also the laymen of Pāṭaligāma, after washing their feet, and entering the rest house, sat down in front of the Gracious One near the East wall, facing the West, having the Gracious One in front of them.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>Then the Gracious One addressed the laymen of Pāṭaligāma, saying: "There are these five dangers, householders, for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue. What are the five?</p>

<hr>
<p>Here, householders, one lacking in virtue, one who has lost his virtue, because of being heedless undergoes a great loss of riches. This is the first danger for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.</p>

<hr>
<p>Furthermore, householders, for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue, a bad report goes round. This is the second danger for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.</p>

<hr>
<p>Furthermore, householders, one lacking in virtue, one who has lost his virtue, whatever assembly he approaches, whether an assembly of Nobles, or an assembly of brahmins, or an assembly of householders, or an assembly of ascetics, he approaches without confidence, with confusion. This is the third danger for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.</p>

<hr>
<p>Furthermore, householders, one lacking in virtue, one who has lost his virtue, dies bewildered. This is the fourth danger for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.</p>

<hr>
<p>Furthermore, householders, one lacking in virtue, one who has lost his virtue, at the break-up of the body, after death, arises in the lower world, in an unfortunate destiny, in the fall, in the nether regions. This is the fifth danger for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>These are the five dangers, householders, for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue. There are these five advantages, householders, for one who is virtuous, for one accomplished in virtue.What are the five?

<p>These are the five advantages, householders, for one who is virtuous, for one accomplished in virtue."</p>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>Then the Gracious One, after instructing, rousing, enthusing, and cheering the laymen of Pāṭaligāma for most of the night with a talk about the Teaching, dismissed them, saying: "The night has passed, householders, now is the time for whatever you are thinking."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," said those laymen of Pāṭaligāma, and after replying to the Gracious One, rising from their seats, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, went away.</p>

<p>Then the Gracious One, not long after the laymen of Pāṭaligāma had gone, entered an empty place.</p>

<h3>12: Building up Pāṭaligāma</h3>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>Now at that time the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra were building up a city at Pāṭaligāma to ward off the Vajjians. Then at that time a great many Divinities, thousands upon thousands, were taking possession of grounds at Pāṭaligāma.</p>

<p>In that place where the great Divinities took possession of grounds, there the powerful rulers and great royal ministers' minds inclined to building up residences.</p>

<p>In that place where the middling Divinities took possession of grounds, there the middling rulers and middling royal ministers' minds inclined to building up residences.</p>

<p>In that place where the lower Divinities took possession of grounds, there the lower rulers and lower royal ministers' minds inclined to building up residences.</p>

<p>The Gracious One saw with his Divine-eye, which is purified, and surpasses that of normal men, that those Divinities, thousands upon thousands, were taking possession of grounds at Pāṭaligāma.</p>

<p>Then towards the time of dawn, having risen from his seat, the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Now who, Ānanda, is building a city at Pāṭaligāma?"</p>

<p>"The Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra, reverend Sir, are building up a city at Pāṭaligāma to ward off the Vajjians."</p>

<p>"It is just as though, Ānanda, they are building after consulting with the Tāvatiṁsa Divinities, so, Ānanda, are the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra building up a city at Pāṭaligāma to ward off the Vajjians.</p>

<p>Here, Ānanda, I saw with my Divine-eye, which is purified, and surpasses that of normal men, that a great many Divinities, thousands upon thousands, were taking possession of grounds at Pāṭaligāma.</p>

<p>In that place where the great Divinities took possession of grounds, there the powerful rulers and great royal ministers' minds inclined to building up residences.</p>

<p>In that place where the middling Divinities took possession of grounds, there the middling rulers and middling royal ministers' minds inclined to building up residences.</p>

<p>In that place where the lower Divinities took possession of grounds, there the lower rulers and lower royal ministers' minds inclined to building up residences.</p>

<p>For as long, Ānanda, as there is an Ariyan sphere of influence, for as long as there is trade, this basket-opening Pāṭaliputta will be the chief city. For Pāṭaliputta, Ānanda, there will be three dangers: from fire and from water and from the breaking of an alliance."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra approached the Gracious One, and after approaching, they exchanged greetings with the Gracious One, and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings, they stood on one side. While standing on one side the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra said this to the Gracious One: "May dear Gotama consent to us offering him a meal today, together with the Community of monks." The Gracious One consented by maintaining silence.</p>

<p>Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra having understood the Gracious One's consent, approached their own dwelling, and after approaching, in their own dwellings, having had excellent foodstuffs made ready, had the time announced to the Gracious One, saying: "It is time, dear Gotama, the meal is ready."</p>

<p>Then the Gracious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, together with the Community of monks, approached the dwelling of the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra, and after approaching, he sat down on the prepared seat.</p>

<hr>
<p>Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra with their own hands served and satisfied the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head with excellent foodstuffs. Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra, when the Gracious One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, having taken a low seat, sat down on one side.</p>

<hr>
<p>While sitting on one side the Gracious One rejoiced the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra with these verses:</p>

<hr>
<p class="verse">"In that place where he makes his dwelling, having entertained
<br>The wise and virtuous here, the restrained, who live the spiritual life,<br>
<br>He should dedicate a gift of merit to those Divinities who were in that place.
<br>Honoured, they pay honour, revered, they revere him.</p>

<p class="verse">Thereafter they have compassion on him, as a mother on her own son,
<br>A man whom the Divinities has compassion on always sees what is auspicious."</p>

<hr>
<p>Then the Gracious One after rejoicing the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra with these verses, after rising from his seat, went away.</p>

<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>Now at that time the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra were following close behind the Gracious One, thinking: "That gate by which the ascetic Gotama leaves will get the name the Gotama Gate, and that ford by which he crosses the river Ganges will get the name the Gotama Ford."</p>

<p>Then that gate by which the Gracious One left got the name the Gotama Gate. Then the Gracious One approached the river Ganges. Now at that time the river Ganges was full to the brim, and could be drunk from by crows perched on the bank. Some of the people were seeking boats, some were seeking floats, and some were binding rafts, desiring to go from this shore to the shore beyond.</p>

<p>Then the Gracious One, just as a strong man might stretch out a bent arm, or bend in an outstretched arm, so did he vanish from the near bank of the river Ganges, and reappeared on the far bank, together with the Community of monks.</p>

<p>The Gracious One saw those people, some seeking boats, some seeking floats, and some binding rafts, desiring to go from this shore to the shore beyond.</p>

<hr>
<p>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>

<p class="verse">"Those who cross over a sea or a river,
<br>Do so after making a bridge, and leaving the marshes behind.
<br>While people are still binding together a raft,
<br>Intelligent people have crossed over."</p>

<h3>13: The Four Noble Truths</h3>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>Then the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Come Ānanda let us approach Koṭigāma." "Very well, reverend Sir," venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Koṭigāma. There the Gracious One lived near Koṭigāma.</p>

<hr>
<p>There the Gracious One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p>"Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration, monks, of Four Noble Truths both you and I have been wandering and running along in Saṁsāra for a long time.</p>

<hr>
<p>Which four?</p>

<p>Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration, monks, of the Noble Truth of Suffering both you and I have been wandering and running along in Saṁsāra for a long time.</p>

<p>Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration, monks, of the Noble Truth of the Arising of Suffering both you and I have been wandering and running along in Saṁsāra for a long time.</p>

<p>Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration, monks, of the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering both you and I have been wandering and running along in Saṁsāra for a long time.</p>

<p>Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration, monks, of the Noble Truth of the Practice going to the Cessation of Suffering both you and I have been wandering and running along in Saṁsāra for a long time.</p>

<p>But now the Noble Truth of Suffering has been understood and penetrated, the Noble Truth of the Arising of Suffering has been understood and penetrated, the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering has been understood and penetrated, the Noble Truth of the Practice going to the Cessation of Suffering has been understood and penetrated. Craving for continued existence has been cut off, what leads to rebirth has been exhausted, there is no continuation in existence."</p>

<p>The Gracious One said this, and after saying this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, said something more:</p>

<p class="verse">"Because of not seeing as it really is the Four Noble Truths
<br>we have run along for a long time through various births.<br>Now these have been seen, uprooted is what leads to rebirth,
<br>the root of suffering has been cut off, there is no continuation in existence."</p>

<p>There also the Gracious One, while living in Koṭigāma, spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, saying:</p>

<p>"Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom, when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration, when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom, when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants, that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of craving for continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance."</p>

<h3>14: The Mirror of the True Nature of Things</h3>

<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>Then the Gracious One, after living near Koṭigāma for as long as he liked, addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Come Ānanda let us approach the Nādikas."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One together with a great Community of monks arrived at the Nādikas. There the Gracious One lived near one of the Nādikas in the Brick House.<span class="note" id="n373"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.373] Most buildings being of wood, this was exceptional, hence its name.</span></span></span></p>

<p>In excess of ninety laymen, Ānanda, have died in Nādika who, through the complete destruction of three fetters, and the diminuation of passion, hatred, and delusion are Once-Returners, and will return only once more to this world, and then will make an end to suffering.</p>

<p>In excess of five-hundred laymen, Ānanda, have died in Nādika who, through the complete destruction of three fetters, are Stream-Enterers, no longer subject to falling into the lower realms, and have a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>But it is not such a wonder, Ānanda, that those who have become human should die, but if every time there is a death in this place, after approaching the Realised One, you were to ask about it, Ānanda, that would be troublesome<span class="note" id="n375"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.375] DA stresses that Buddhas can feel only physical, not mental weariness.</span></span></span> to the Realised One.</p>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>And what, Ānanda, is this presentation of the Teaching called the Mirror of the True Nature of Things, endowed with which a Noble Disciple desiring to do so may declare about himself: 'Exhausted is birth in Hell, exhausted is birth in an animal's womb, exhausted is birth in the realm of the Fallen Spirits, exhausted is falling into an unfortunate destiny in the lower realms, I am a Stream-Enterer, no longer subject to falling into the lower realms, and have a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening'?</p>

<hr>
<p>Here, Ānanda, a Noble Disciple is endowed with perfect confidence in the Buddha thinking:<span class="note" id="n377"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.377] ‘Has no doubt’ (i.e. has, by ‘entering the Stream’, transcended doubt).</span></span></span></p>

<p>He is endowed with perfect confidence in the Teaching thinking:</p>

<p>'The Teaching has been well-proclaimed by the Gracious One, it is visible, not subject to time, inviting inspection, onward leading, and can be understood by the wise for themselves.'</p>

<p>'The Gracious One's Community of disciples are good in their practice, the Gracious One's Community of disciples are straight in their practice, the Gracious One's Community of disciples are systematic in their practice, the Gracious One's Community of disciples are correct in their practice, that is to say, the four pairs of persons,<span class="note" id="n378"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.378] The eight are the one who has gained the state of Stream-Winner, and the one who has gained its ‘fruition’ (counted separately), and similarly for the three higher stages.

<p>This is the presentation of the Teaching, Ānanda, called the Mirror of the True Nature of Things endowed with which a Noble Disciple desiring to do so may declare about himself: 'Exhausted is Hell, exhausted is birth in an animal's womb, exhausted is birth in the realm of the Fallen Spirits, exhausted is falling into an unfortunate destiny in the lower realms, I am a Stream-Enterer, no longer subject to falling into the lower realms, and have a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening.'"</p>

<hr>
<p>There also the Gracious One, while living near Nādika in the Brick House, spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, saying: "Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom, when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration, when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom, when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants, that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of craving for continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance."</p>

<p id="p30"><span class="parno">30</span>Then the Gracious One, after living near Nādika for as long as he liked, addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Come Ānanda let us approach Vesālī."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Vesālī. There the Gracious One lived near Vesālī in Ambapālī's Wood. There the Gracious One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p>"Mindfully<span class="note" id="n381"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.381] For this and the next verse, see <a href="../dn/dn22.html">DN&nbsp;22.1</a>.</span></span></span> and with full awareness, monks, a monk should live, this is our advice to you. And how, monks, is a monk mindful?</p>

<p>Here, monks, a monk dwells contemplating the nature of the body in the body, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world; he dwells contemplating the nature of feelings in feelings, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world; he dwells contemplating the nature of the mind in the mind, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world; he dwells contemplating the nature of things in various things, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world.</p>

<p>Thus, monks, a monk is mindful. And how, monks, does a monk have full awareness?</p>

<p>Here, monks, a monk in going forwards, in going back, is one who practises with full awareness, in looking ahead, or in looking around, he is one who practises with full awareness, in bending or in stretching, he is one who practises with full awareness, in bearing his double-robe, bowl, and other robes, he is one who practises with full awareness, in eating, in drinking, in chewing, in tasting, he is one who practises with full awareness, in passing stool and urine, he is one who practises with full awareness, in going, in standing, in sitting, in sleeping, in waking, in talking, and in maintaining silence, he is one who practises with full awareness.</p>

<p>Thus, monks, a monk has full awareness. Mindfully and with full awareness, monks, a monk should live, this is our advice to you."</p>

<h3>15: The Courtesan Ambapālī</h3>

<p id="p31"><span class="parno">31</span>The courtesan Ambapālī<span class="note" id="n383"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.383] <i>Ganikā.</i> She was a rich and cultivated woman, with skills similar to those of a geisha.</span></span></span> heard: "The Gracious One, it seems, has reached Vesālī and is living near Vesālī in my Mango Wood."</p>

<p>Then the courtesan Ambapālī, after having many great and august vehicles prepared, and mounting those great and august vehicles, departed with those great and august vehicles from Vesālī, and after approaching by vehicle to her pleasure garden as far as the ground for vehicles would allow, and descending from the vehicles, she approached the Gracious One by foot, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, she sat down on one side. While the courtesan Ambapālī was sitting on one side the Gracious One instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered her with a talk about the Teaching.</p>

<p>Then the courtesan Ambapālī, having been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Gracious One with a talk about the Teaching, said to the Gracious One: "May the Gracious One consent, reverend Sir, to me offering him a meal on the morrow, together with the Community of monks."</p>

<p>The Gracious One consented by maintaining silence. Then the courtesan Ambapālī, having understood the Gracious One's consent, after rising from her seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, went away.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Licchavīs from Vesālī heard: "The Gracious One, it seems, had reached Vesālī and is living near Vesālī in Ambapālī's Wood."</p>

<p>Then those Licchavīs, after having many great and august vehicles prepared, and mounting those great and august vehicles, departed with those great and august vehicles from Vesālī. There some of the Licchavīs were blue,<span class="note" id="n384"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.384] <i>Nīla:</i> variously rendered as ‘dark blue, blue-green’, etc.</span></span></span> having a blue appearance,<span class="note" id="n385"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.385] Men wore cosmetics of various colours.</span></span></span> with blue clothes and blue decorations; some of the Licchavīs were yellow, having a yellow appearance, with yellow clothes and yellow decorations; some of the Licchavīs were red, having a red appearance, with red clothes and red decorations; some of the Licchavīs were white, having a white appearance, with white clothes and white decorations.</p>

<p>Then the courtesan Ambapālī rolled alongside the Licchavī youths axle by axle, wheel by wheel, and yoke by yoke. Then those Licchavīs said this to the courtesan Ambapālī: "Why do you, Ambapālī, roll alongside the Licchavī youths axle by axle, wheel by wheel, and yoke by yoke?"</p>

<p>"Because I have invited the Gracious One, noble sirs, for a meal on the morrow, together with the Community of monks."</p>

<p>"Give us this meal, Ambapālī, for a hundred thousand <i>kahapanas</i>."</p>

<p>"If, noble sirs, you would give Vesālī and its revenues<span class="note" id="n386"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.386] <i>Sâhāraṁ:</i> lit. ‘with its food’, i.e. revenue.</span></span></span> still I would not give this meal to you."</p>

<p>Then the Licchavīs snapped their fingers, thinking: "We have surely been defeated by a woman,<span class="note" id="n387"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.387] A play on <i>amba</i> ‘mango’ and <i>ambakā</i> ‘woman’. Her name means ‘mango-guardian”.</span></span></span> we have surely been defeated by a woman."</p>

<hr>
<p>Then the Licchavīs entered Ambapālī's Wood. The Gracious One saw those Licchavīs coming from afar, and having seen them, he addressed the monks, saying: "Let those monks who have not seen the Tāvatiṁsa Divinities, monks, look at the Licchavī troupe, monks, look upon the Licchavī troupe, monks, contemplate the Licchavī troupe, monks, who are like the Tāvatiṁsa Divinities."</p>

<hr>
<p>Then after the Licchavīs had gone as far as the ground for vehicles would allow, and had descended from the vehicles, they approached the Gracious One by foot, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, they sat down at one side.</p>

<p>While the Licchavīs were sitting on one side the Gracious One instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered them with a talk about the Teaching. Then the Licchavīs, having been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Gracious One with a talk about the Teaching, said to the Gracious One: "Please consent to us offering a meal on the morrow, together with the Community of monks."</p>

<hr>
<p>"I have already consented to the courtesan Ambapālī's meal on the morrow."</p>

<p>Then the Licchavīs snapped their fingers, thinking: "We have surely been defeated by a woman, we have surely been defeated by a woman."</p>

<p>Then the Licchavīs, after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of the Gracious One, rising from their seats, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, went away.</p>

<p id="p32"><span class="parno">32</span>Then the courtesan Ambapālī after the night had passed, having had excellent foodstuffs made ready in her own pleasure park, had the time announced to the Gracious One, saying: "It is time, reverend Sir, the meal is ready."</p>

<p>Then the Gracious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, together with the Community of monks, approached the courtesan Ambapālī's residence, and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat. Then the courtesan Ambapālī with her own hand served and satisfied the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head with excellent foodstuffs.</p>

<p>Then the courtesan Ambapālī, when the Gracious One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, having taken a certain low seat, sat down on one side. While sitting on one side the courtesan Ambapālī said this to the Gracious One: "I donate this pleasure park, reverend Sir, to the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head."</p>

<p>The Gracious One accepted the pleasure park. Then the Gracious One, after instructing, rousing, enthusing, and cheering the courtesan Ambapālī with a talk about the Teaching, having risen from the seat, went away.</p>

<hr>
<p>There also the Gracious One, while living in Vesālī in Ambapālī's Wood, spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, saying:</p>

<p>"Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom, when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration, when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom, when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants, that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of craving for continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance."</p>

<h3>16: The Gracious One's Sickness</h3>

<p id="p33"><span class="parno">33</span>Then the Gracious One, after living near Ambapālī's Wood for as long as he liked, addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Come Ānanda let us approach the little village of Beluva."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One together with a great Community of monks arrived at the little village of Beluva. There the Gracious One lived near the little village of Beluva.</p>

<p>There the Gracious One addressed the monks, saying: "Go, monks, and undertake the Rains Retreat in the vicinity of Vesālī living like friends, like companions, like comrades, and I will spend the Rains Retreat right here at the little village of Beluva."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," and those monks, after replying to the Gracious One, undertook the Rains Retreat in the vicinity of Vesālī living like friends, like companions, like comrades. But the Gracious One spent the Rains Retreat right there at the little village of Beluva.</p>

<p>Then while dwelling for the Rains Retreat, a heavy affliction arose for the Gracious One, and continued with strong and death-like feelings. There the Gracious One dwelt mindfully, with full awareness, and without being troubled. Then this occurred to the Gracious One: "It is not suitable that I, without having addressed my attendants, without having given notice to the Community of monks, should attain Final Emancipation. Having energetically dismissed this affliction, I could live on after determining the lifespan."</p>

<p id="p34"><span class="parno">34</span>Then the Gracious One having energetically dismissed that affliction lived on after determining the lifespan. Then the Gracious One's affliction abated. Then, the Gracious One, having risen from that sickness, not long after rising, departed from the Sick Room and sat down on the prepared seat in front of that Room.</p>

<p>Then venerable Ānanda approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sitting on one side venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One:</p>

<p>"I have seen, reverend Sir, the Gracious One comfortable, I have seen, reverend Sir, the Gracious One bearing up while sick, and my body, reverend Sir, became faint as it were, and although I could not see straight, and things were not clear, it appeared to me, reverend Sir, that the Gracious One was sick, but it was some small comfort that the Gracious One would not attain Final Emancipation until the Gracious One had spoken regarding the Community of monks."</p>

<p id="p35"><span class="parno">35</span>"But what, Ānanda, does the Community of monks expect of me? The Teaching has been taught by me, Ānanda, without having made a distinction between esoteric and exoteric,<span class="note" id="n388"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.388] A famous statement, implying that there is no ‘esoteric’ teaching in Buddhism, at least as originally taught by the Founder. There is no contradiction with the parable of the siṁsapā leaves at <a href="../sn/sn56.31.html">SN&nbsp;56.31</a>.</span></span></span> for the Realised One there is nothing, Ānanda, of a closed teacher's fist in regard to the Teaching.</p>

<p>To whoever, Ānanda, this thought occurs: 'I will lead the Community of monks'<span class="note" id="n389"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.389] <i>Pariharissāmi:</i> ‘I will take care of’.</span></span></span> or 'I am the instructer of the Community of monks' let him speak, Ānanda, regarding the Community of monks. But to the Realised One, Ānanda, this thought does not occur: 'I will lead the Community of monks' or 'I am the instructor of the Community of monks'. Then why, Ānanda, should the Realised One speak regarding the Community of monks?</p>

<hr>
<p>I, Ānanda, at present, am old, elderly, of great age, far gone, advanced in years, I am eighty years old.<span class="note" id="n390"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.390] The idea that the Buddha died at the age of eighty has, for some reason, been considered implausible. We might as well query the fact that Wordsworth died shortly after his eightieth birthday, the year of his death, too, bearing the suspiciously ‘round’ figure of 1850! See <a href="#n400">n.400</a>.</span></span></span> It is like, Ānanda, an old cart, which only keeps going when shored up with bamboo,<span class="note" id="n391"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.391] <i>Vegha-missakena.</i> The precise meaning of the expression seems to be unknown, but it ["being bound together with straps" —Walshe] remains a vivid image!</span></span></span> just so, Ānanda, I think the Realised One's body only keeps going when shored up with bamboo.</p>

<p>When the Realised One doesn't pay attention, Ānanda, to any of the signs,<span class="note" id="n392"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.392] <i>Sabba-nimittānaṁ amanasikārā:</i> ‘not attending to any signs’, i.e. ideas.</span></span></span> when all feelings have ceased,<span class="note" id="n393"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.393] I.e. mundane feelings (DA).</span></span></span> he lives having established the signless mind-concentration,<span class="note" id="n394"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.394]‘The concentration attained during intensive insight-meditation’ (AA, quoted in LDB).</span></span></span> and at that time, Ānanda, the Realised One's body is most comfortable.</p>

<hr>
<p>Therefore, Ānanda, live with yourself as an island,<span class="note" id="n395"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.395] <i>Dīpa</i> = Skt. <i>dvīpa</i> ‘island’ rather than Skt. <i>dīpa</i> ‘lamp’. But we do not really know whether the Buddha pronounced the two words alike or not! In the absence of such knowledge, it is perhaps best not to be too dogmatic about the meaning. In any case, it is just ‘oneself’ that one has to have as one’s ‘island’ (or lamp), not some ‘great self’ which the Buddha did not teach (cf. <a href="#n363">n.363,</a> end).</span></span></span> yourself as a refuge, with no other refuge, with the Teaching as an island, the Teaching as a refuge, with no other refuge. And how, Ānanda, does a monk live with himself as an island, himself as a refuge, with no other refuge, with the Teaching as an island, the Teaching as a refuge, with no other refuge?</p>

<hr>
<p>Here, Ānanda, a monk dwells contemplating the nature of the body in the body … feelings in feelings … the mind in the mind … things in various things, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world.</p>

<p>Thus, Ānanda, a monk lives with himself as an island, himself as a refuge, with no other refuge, with the Teaching as an island, the Teaching as a refuge, with no other refuge. For whoever, Ānanda, whether at present or after my passing, lives with himself as an island, himself as a refuge, with no other refuge, with the Teaching as an island, the Teaching as a refuge, with no other refuge, those monks of mine, Ānanda, will go from darkness to the highest<span class="note" id="n396"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.396] <i>Tamatagge.</i> The meaning of this is rather obscure, to say the least. It seems to mean something like ‘the highest’, even if scholars cannot agree as to how this meaning is reached. See the long note (28) in LDB.</span></span></span>—whoever likes the training."</p>

<p class="endsection">The Second Chapter for Recital is Finished.</p>

<h3>17: Ānanda's Failure</h3>

<p id="p36"><span class="parno">36</span>Then the Gracious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. After walking for alms in Vesālī, and returning from the alms-round after the meal, he addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Take up the sitting mat, Ānanda, we will approach the Cāpāla shrine to dwell for the day."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One, and taking the sitting mat, he followed along close behind the Gracious One.</p>

<p>Then the Gracious One approached the Cāpāla shrine, and after approaching, he sat down on the prepared seat, and also venerable Ānanda, after worshipping the Gracious One, sat down on one side.</p>

<p id="p37"><span class="parno">37</span>While sitting on one side the Gracious One said this to venerable Ānanda:</p>

<hr>
<p>"Delightful, Ānanda, is Vesālī, delightful is the Udena shrine, delightful is the Gotamaka shrine, delightful is the Sattamba shrine,<span class="note" id="n397"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.397] The ‘Seven Mangoes’ Shrine.</span></span></span> delightful is the Many Sons' shrine,<span class="note" id="n398"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.398] <i>Bahuputta,</i> the ‘Many Sons’ Shrine, at which people used to pray for sons to an ancient banyan-tree.</span></span></span> delightful is the Sārandada shrine, delightful is the Cāpāla shrine.</p>

<p>Whoever has developed, Ānanda, made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power,<span class="note" id="n399"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.399] <i>Iddhipādā.</i> See <a href="../dn/dn18.html#p36">DN&nbsp;18.36.</a></span></span></span> could, if he wanted, Ānanda, remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan. The Realised One has developed, Ānanda, made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power. If he wanted, Ānanda, the Realised One could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan."<span class="note" id="n400"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.400] <i>Kappaṁ vā tiṭṭheyya kappâvasesaṁ vā.</i> This passage is much disputed. The usual meaning of <i>kappa</i> is ‘aeon’ (but see PED for other senses). DA, however, takes it to mean ‘the full life-span’ (i.e. in Gotama’s day, 100 years: cf. <a href="../dn/dn14.html#p8">DN&nbsp;14.8</a>). DA also takes avasesa to mean ‘in excess’ (the usual meaning being ‘the remainder’). After some hesitation, and preferring the lesser ‘miracle’, I have translated the sense of kappa (as I take it) by ‘a century’. This, of course, accords with DA. I have, however, adopted the usual meaning of <i>avasesa</i> as making good sense. For the Buddha, the ‘remainder’ would have been twenty years. PTS translators of the parallel passages have differed in their interpretations. Whereas RD in DN preferred ‘aeon’, Woodward at <a href="../sn/sn51.10.html">SN&nbsp;51.10</a> (followed reluctantly by Hare at AN 8.70!) has ‘allotted span’, and at <a href="../ud/ud6.1.html">Ud&nbsp;6.1</a> he tersely remarks: ‘Supposed by some to mean “the aeon or world-period”’. It may be noted that LDB has ‘world-period’, while Mrs Bennett discreetly omits the passage.</span></span></span></p>

<p>But venerable Ānanda, despite such a gross hint being made by the Gracious One, such a gross suggestion being made, was unable to penetrate it, and did not beg the Gracious One, saying: "May the Gracious One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan, may the Fortunate One remain for the lifespan, for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men," like one whose mind was possessed by Māra.<span class="note" id="n401"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.401] Māra (= ‘Death’) is the personified spirit of evil, the Tempter, very like the Biblical Satan. But like Brahmā, he is only the temporary incumbent of an ‘office’.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p>For a second time the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Delightful, Ānanda, is Vesālī, delightful is the Udena shrine, delightful is the Gotamaka shrine, delightful is the Sattamba shrine, delightful is the Many Sons' shrine, delightful is the Sārandada shrine, delightful is the Cāpāla shrine.</p>

<p>Whoever has developed, Ānanda, made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power, could, if he wanted, remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan. The Realised One has developed, Ānanda, made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power. If he wanted, Ānanda, the Realised One could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan."</p>

<p>But venerable Ānanda, despite such a gross hint being made by the Gracious One, such a gross suggestion being made, was unable to penetrate it, and did not beg the Gracious One, saying: "May the Gracious One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan, may the Fortunate One remain for the lifespan, for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men," like one whose mind was possessed by Māra.</p>

<hr>
<p>For a third time the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Delightful, Ānanda, is Vesālī, delightful is the Udena shrine, delightful is the Gotamaka shrine, delightful is the Sattamba shrine, delightful is the Many Sons' shrine, delightful is the Sārandada shrine, delightful is the Cāpāla shrine.</p>

<p>Whoever has developed, Ānanda, made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power, could, if he wanted, remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan. The Realised One has developed, Ānanda, made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power. If he wanted, Ānanda, the Realised One could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan."</p>

<p>But venerable Ānanda, despite such a gross hint being made by the Gracious One, such a gross suggestion being made, was unable to penetrate it, and did not beg the Gracious One, saying: "May the Gracious One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan, may the Fortunate One remain for the lifespan, for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men," like one whose mind was possessed by Māra.</p>

<p>Then the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Go, Ānanda, now is the time for whatever you are thinking."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One, rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, he sat down not far away at the root of a certain tree.</p>

<h3>18: The Relinquishment of the Life Process</h3>

<p id="p38"><span class="parno">38</span>Then the Wicked Māra, not long after venerable Ānanda had gone, approached the Gracious One, and after approaching, he stood on one side. While standing on one side the Wicked Māra said this to the Gracious One:</p>

<p>"May the Gracious One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Gracious One's Final Emancipation.</p>

<hr>
<p>For these words, reverend Sir, were spoken by the Gracious One:</p>

<p>'I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One, for as long as my monks are not true disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned, bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching, and having learned it from their own teacher, will declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain—after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen—and teach the miraculous Teaching.'<span class="note" id="n402"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.402] <i>Sappāṭihāriyaṁ dhammaṁ.</i> RD renders this ‘the wonder-working truth’, to which the Ven.

<p>But at present, reverend Sir, the Gracious One's monks are true disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned, bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching, and having learned it from their own teacher, do declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain—after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen—and teach the miraculous Teaching.</p>

<hr>
<p>When that was said the Gracious One said this to the Wicked Māra: "You should have little concern, Wicked One, in no long time the Realised One will be Finally Emancipated, after three months have passed from now, the Realised One will attain Final Emancipation."</p>

<p id="p39"><span class="parno">39</span>Then at the Cāpāla shrine the Gracious One, mindfully, with full awareness, relinquished the life-process. With the relinquishment of the life-process by the Gracious One there was a great earthquake, and a fearful, horrifying crash of the Divinities' thunder drum.</p>

<p>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>

<p class="verse">"Measurable and immeasurable continuity,
<br>And the continuation-process the Sage relinquished.
<br>Content in himself, and concentrated,
<br>He broke continuity of self like a coat of mail."<span class="note" id="n403"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.403] ‘As a warrior breaks his armour after the battle’ (DA).</span></span></span></p>

<h3>19: Eight Reasons for Earthquakes</h3>

<p id="p40"><span class="parno">40</span>Then it occured to venerable Ānanda: "Surely it is wonderful, surely it is marvellous, this great earthquake, this very great earthquake, and this awful, hair-raising, crash of the Divinities' thunder drum. What was the reason, what was the cause, for the occurrence of this great earthquake?"</p>

<p>Then venerable Ānanda approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down at one side. Sitting on one side venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: "Surely it is wonderful, reverend Sir, surely it is marvellous, reverend Sir, this great earthquake, this very great earthquake, and this awful, hair-raising, crash of the Divinities' thunder drum. What was the reason, reverend Sir, what was the cause, for the occurrence of this great earthquake?"</p>

<p id="p41"><span class="parno">41</span>"There are these eight reasons, eight causes, Ānanda, for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>

<p>Which eight?</p>

<p>This great Earth, Ānanda, stands in the water, the water stands in the atmosphere, the atmosphere stands in space. There comes a time, Ānanda, when great winds blow, with the great winds blowing, the waters move, the waters having moved, the Earth moves. This is the first reason, the first cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake. (1)</p>

<p>Furthermore, Ānanda, when an ascetic or a brahmin or a Divinity, one of great power, one of great majesty, has, through spiritual power, attained complete mastery of the mind, and has then developed even a trifling perception of the Earth, or an unlimited perception of water,<span class="note" id="n404"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.404] DA has an involved and dubious explanation. The point, surely, is that there is an imbalance in the powers of such a mighty deva (who, of course, is far from being enlightened!).</span></span></span> this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the second reason, the second cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake. (2)</p>

<p>Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Buddha-to-be falls away from the Tusita hosts, and mindfully, with full awareness, enters his mother's womb, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the third reason, the third cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake. (3)</p>

<p>Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Buddha-to-be mindfully, with full awareness, exits his mother's womb, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the fourth reason, the fourth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake. (4)</p>

<p>Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Realised One perfectly awakens to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the fifth reason, the fifth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake. (5)</p>

<p>Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Realised One sets the unsurpassed wheel of the Teaching rolling, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the sixth reason, the sixth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake. (6)</p>

<p>Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Realised One mindfully, with full awareness gives up the life-process, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the seventh reason, the seventh cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake. (7)</p>

<p>Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Realised One is Finally Emancipated in the Emancipation-element which has no basis for attachment remaining,<span class="note" id="n405"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.405] <i>Anupādisesāya nibbāna-dhātuya parinibbāyati:</i> ‘enters the Nibbāna-element without the groups (of attachment) remaining’; or, in mundane parlance, ‘dies’. See BDic under Nibbāna.</span></span></span> this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the eighth reason, the eighth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake. (8)</p>

<p>These are the eight reasons, the eight causes, Ānanda, for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>

<h3>20: The Eight Assemblies</h3>

<p id="70"><span class="parno">42</span>There are, Ānanda, eight assemblies.</p>

<hr>
<p>Which eight?</p>

<hr>
<p>The assembly of Nobles, the assembly of brahmins, the assembly of householders, the assembly of ascetics, the assembly of the Four Great Kings, the assembly of the Tāvatiṁsa Divinities, the assembly of Māra, the assembly of the Brahmā Divinities.</p>

<hr>
<p>I know, Ānanda, after approaching countless hundreds of assemblies of Nobles<span class="note" id="n406"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.406] Or: ‘assemblies of many hundreds of Khattiyas’.</span></span></span> … brahmins … householders … ascetics … the Four Great Kings … Tāvatiṁsa Divinities … Māra … Brahmā Divinities, that there, before settling down, before conversing, and before entering upon discussion, whatever their appearance was, my appearance would become, whatever their voice was, my voice would become, and I instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered them with a talk about the Teaching, and while I was speaking they did not know me and would ask: 'Who is this speaking, a Divinity or a man?' and having instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered them with a talk about the Teaching, I disappeared. And when I had disappeared they did not know me and would ask: 'Who is this who disappeared, a Divinity or a man?'</p>

<hr>
<p>These, Ānanda, are the eight assemblies.</p>

<h3>21: The Eight Means of Mind mastery</h3>

<p id="p43"><span class="parno">43</span>There are, Ānanda, eight means of mind mastery.<span class="note" id="n407"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.407] <i>Abhibhū-ayatanāni</i> &gt; <i>abhibhâyatanāni.</i> See <a href="../mn/mn77.html">MN&nbsp;77</a> and articles in BDic and EB.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Which eight?</p>

<hr>
<p>Perceiving forms internally,<span class="note" id="n408"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.408] On one’s own person.</span></span></span> someone sees forms externally, limited, beautiful or ugly, and having mastered them, he is one who perceives thus: 'I know, I see'. This is the first means of mind mastery. (1)</p>

<hr>
<p>Perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally, unlimited, beautiful or ugly, and having mastered them, he is one who perceives thus: 'I know, I see'. This is the second means of mind mastery. (2)</p>

<p>Without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally, limited, beautiful or ugly, and having mastered them, he is one who perceives thus: 'I know, I see'. This is the third means of mind mastery. (3)</p>

<p>Without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally, unlimited, beautiful or ugly, and having mastered them, he is one who perceives thus: 'I know, I see'. This is the fourth means of mind mastery. (4)</p>

<p>Without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally, blue, blue-coloured, of blue appearance, shiny blue, just as the flower called Ummā is blue, blue-coloured, of blue appearance, shiny blue, or just as there is Banaras cloth smoothed on both sides that is blue, blue-coloured, of blue appearance, shiny blue, so, without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally, blue, blue-coloured, of blue appearance, shiny blue, and having mastered them, he is one who perceives thus: 'I know, I see'. This is the fifth means of mind mastery. (5)</p>

<p>Without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally, yellow, yellow-coloured, of yellow appearance, shiny yellow, just as the flower called Kaṇikāra<span class="note" id="n409"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.409] The flower of the tree <i>Pterospermum acerifolium</i>.</span></span></span> is yellow, yellow-coloured, of yellow appearance, shiny yellow, or just as there is Banaras cloth smoothed on both sides that is yellow, yellow-coloured, of yellow appearance, shiny yellow, so, without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally, yellow, yellow colour, of yellow appearance, shiny yellow, and having mastered them, he is one who perceives thus: 'I know, I see'. This is the sixth means of mind mastery. (6)</p>

<p>Without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally, red, red-coloured, of red appearance, shiny red, just as the flower called Bandhujīvaka is red, red-coloured, of red appearance, shiny red, or just as there is Banaras cloth smoothed on both sides that is red, red-coloured, of red appearance, shiny red, so, without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally, red, red-coloured, of red appearance, shiny red, and having mastered them, he is one who perceives thus: 'I know, I see'. This is the seventh means of mind mastery. (7)</p>

<p>Without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally, white, white-coloured, of white appearance, shiny white, just as the Osadhī star,<span class="note" id="n410"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.410] The ‘healing star’, equated with Venus.</span></span></span> is white, white-coloured, of white appearance, shiny white, or just as there is Banaras cloth smoothed on both sides that is white, white-coloured, of white appearance, shiny white, so, without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally, white, white-coloured, of white appearance, shiny white, and having mastered them, he is one who perceives thus: 'I know, I see'. This is the eighth means of mind mastery. (8)</p>

<hr>
<p>These, Ānanda, are the eight means of mind mastery.</p>

<h3>22: The Eight Liberations</h3>

<p id="p44"><span class="parno">44</span>There are, Ānanda, eight liberations. Which eight?</p>

<p>One having form sees forms. This is the first liberation. (1)</p>

<p>Not perceiving forms internally, he sees forms externally. This is the second liberation. (2)</p>

<p>One is intent on endless beauty. This is the third liberation. (3)</p>

<p>Having completely transcended perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact, not attending to perceptions of variety, understanding: 'This is endless space', he abides in the sphere of endless space. This is the fourth liberation. (4)</p>

<p>Having completely transcended the sphere of endless space, understanding: 'This is endless consciousness', he abides in the sphere of endless consciousness. This is the fifth liberation. (5)</p>

<p>Having completely transcended the sphere of endless consciousness, understanding: 'This is nothing', he abides in the sphere of nothingness. This is the sixth liberation. (6)</p>

<p>Having completely transcended the sphere of nothingness, he abides in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. This is the seventh liberation. (7)</p>

<p>Having completely transcended the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, he abides in the cessation of perception and feeling. This is the eighth liberation. (8)</p>

<p>These, Ānanda, are the eight liberations.</p>

<h3>23: Ānanda's Fault</h3>

<p id="73"><span class="parno">45</span>At one time Ānanda I was living at Uruvelā, on the bank of the river Nerañjarā, at the root of the Goatherd's Banyan tree, in the first period after attaining Awakening. Then, Ānanda, the Wicked Māra approached me, and after approaching he stood on one side. While standing to one side, Ānanda, the Wicked Māra said this to me:</p>

<hr>
<p>"May the Gracious One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Gracious One's Final Emancipation."</p>

<hr>
<p>After this was said, Ānanda, I said this to the Wicked Māra: "I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One, for as long as my monks are not true disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned, bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching, and having learned it from their own teacher, will declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain—after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen—and teach the miraculous Teaching.</p>

<hr>
<p>I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One, for as long as my nuns are not true disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned, bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching, and having learned it from their own teacher, will declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain—after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen—and teach the miraculous Teaching.</p>

<hr>
<p>I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One, for as long as my laymen are not true disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned, bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching, and having learned it from their own teacher, will declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain—after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen—and teach the miraculous Teaching.</p>

<hr>
<p>I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One, for as long as my laywomen are not true disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned, bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching, and having learned it from their own teacher, will declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain—after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen—and teach the miraculous Teaching.</p>

<hr>
<p>I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One, for as long as this spiritual life of mine has not become successful and prosperous, well spread-out, possessed by many, become great, until it is well-explained amongst Divinities and men."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p46"><span class="parno">46</span>Now today, Ānanda, at the Cāpāla Shrine the Wicked Māra approached me, and after approaching he stood on one side. While standing on one side the Wicked Māra said this to me:</p>

<p>'May the Gracious One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Gracious One's Final Emancipation. For these words, reverend Sir, were spoken by the Gracious One:</p>

<hr>
<p>"I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One, for as long as my monks … nuns … laymen … laywomen are not true disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned, bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching, and having learned it from their own teacher, will declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain—after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen—and teach the miraculous Teaching."</p>

<p>May the Gracious One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Gracious One's Final Emancipation. For the Gracious One has said these words:</p>

<p>"I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One, for as long as this spiritual life of mine has not become successful and prosperous, well spread-out, possessed by many, become great, until it is well-explained amongst Divinities and men."</p>

<hr>
<p>But at present, reverend Sir, the Gracious One's spiritual life is successful and prosperous, well spread-out, possessed by many, become great, it is well-explained amongst Divinities and men.</p>

<p>May the Gracious One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Gracious One's Final Emancipation.'</p>

<hr>
<p id="p47"><span class="parno">47</span>When that was said, Ānanda, I said this to the Wicked Māra: 'You should have little concern, Wicked One, in no long time the Realised One will be Finally Emancipated, after three months have passed from now, the Realised One will attain Final Emancipation.' Now today, Ānanda, at the Cāpāla Shrine the Realised One mindfully, with full awareness, gave up the life-process."</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p id="p48"><span class="parno">48</span>When this was said venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: "Let the Gracious One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan, let the Fortunate One remain for the lifespan, for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, having compassion on the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Enough, Ānanda, do not beg the Realised One, now is the wrong time, Ānanda, for begging the Realised One."</p>

<hr>
<p>For a second time … third time venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: "Let the Gracious One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan, let the Fortunate One remain for the lifespan, for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, having compassion on the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Do you, Ānanda, have faith in the Realised One's Awakening?" "Yes, reverend Sir," "Then why do you, Ānanda, harrass the Realised One up and till the third time?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Face to face with me, reverend Sir, face to face I have heard you say: 'Whoever has developed, Ānanda, made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power, could, if he wanted, remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan. The Realised One has developed, Ānanda, made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power. If he wanted, Ānanda, the Realised One could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan.'"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Do you have faith, Ānanda?" "Yes, reverend Sir,"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Then, Ānanda, there is this wrong-doing for you, there is this fault for you, in that you, despite such a gross hint being made by the Realised One, such a gross suggestion being made, was unable to penetrate it, and did not beg the Realised One, saying: 'May the Gracious One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan; may the Fortunate One remain for the lifespan, for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men.'</p>

<p>If you, Ānanda, had begged the Realised One twice the Realised One might have rejected your speech, but would have accepted it on the third occasion. So, Ānanda, there is this wrong-doing for you, there is this fault for you.</p>

<h3>24: Ānanda's Fault at Rājagaha</h3>

<p><span class="parno">49–50</span>At one time, Ānanda, I was living at Rājagaha on the Vulture's Peak Mountain, I was living right there at Rājagaha near the Gotama Banyan Tree, I was living right there at Rājagaha near the Thieves' Precipice, I was living right there at Rājagaha on the side of the Vebhāra mountain in the Seven Leaves Cave, I was living right there at Rājagaha on the side of the Isigili mountain on Black Rock, I was living right there at Rājagaha in the Cool Wood, at the Snake Tank Slope, I was living right there at Rājagaha in the River Tapodā Monastery, I was living right there near Rājagaha, at Jīvaka's Mango Wood, I was living right there near Rājagaha, in the Deer Park at the place called Crushing Womb, in that place, Ānanda, I addressed you, saying:</p>

<h3>25: Ānanda's Fault at Vesālī</h3>

How can it be otherwise, Ānanda, for that which is obtained, born, become, conditioned, subject to dissolution? It is not possible to say this: 'It should not dissolve'. But this has been relinquished, cast out, let loose, abandoned by the Realised One, forsaken, the life-process that has been given up. For sure this word was spoken by the Realised One:</p>

<p>'Not long now there will be the Realised One's Final Emancipation, after the passing of three months the Realised One will attain Final Emancipation.' The Realised One cannot for the sake of life go back on that, it is not possible.<span class="note" id="n411"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.411] RD says (in part): ‘I do not understand the connexion of ideas between this paragraph and the idea repeated with such tedious iteration in the preceding paragraphs.’ I do not understand what he does not understand.

<h3>26: The Thirty-Seven Things on the Side of Awakening</h3>

<p>Come Ānanda let us approach the Gabled House Hall in Great Wood."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One.</p>

<p>Then the Gracious One with venerable Ānanda approached the Gabled House Hall in Great Wood, and after approaching he addressed venerable Ānanda, saying:</p>

<p>"Go, Ānanda, and whatever monks are living in dependance on Vesālī assemble them in the Attendance Hall."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One and assembling whatever monks were living in dependance on Vesālī in the Attendance Hall, he approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he stood at one side. While standing on one side, venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: "The Community of monks has assembled, reverend Sir, now is the time, Gracious One, for whatever you are thinking."</p>

<p id="p54"><span class="parno">54</span>Then the Gracious One approached the Attendance Hall, and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat. While sitting the Gracious One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p>"Therefore, monks, whatever Teachings have, with deep knowledge, been taught by me, after grasping them well, you should practise, develop, and make a lot of them, so that the Spiritual Life may last long, and may endure for a long time, and that will be for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men.</p>

<p>And what are those Teachings that have, with deep knowledge, been taught by me, which after grasping them well, you should practise, develop, and make a lot of them, so that the Spiritual Life may last long, and may endure for a long time, that will be for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men?</p>

<hr>
<p>They are as follows:</p>

<p class="verse">The Four Ways of Attending to Mindfulness,
<br>the Four Right Strivings,
<br>the Four Paths to Power,
<br>the Five Faculties,<span class="note" id="n412"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.412] The five (spiritual) faculties are: faith (or confidence: <i>saddhā</i>), energy (<i>viriya</i>), mindfulness (<i>sati</i>), concentration (<i>samādhi</i>), and wisdom (<i>paññā</i>).

<br>the Five Strengths,<span class="note" id="n413"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.413] The names of these powers are the same as those of the faculties listed above.

<hr>
<p id="p55"><span class="parno">55</span>Then the Gracious One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p>"Come now, monks, for I tell you all conditioned things are subject to decay, strive on with heedfulness! Not long now there will be the Realised One's Final Emancipation, after the passing of three months the Realised One will attain Final Emancipation."</p>

<hr>
<p>The Gracious One said this, and after saying this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, said something more:</p>

<p class="verse">"Youths and also the old, fools and also the wise,
<br>Rich and also the poor—all end in death.
<br>Like an earthen vessel made by a potter
<br>Small and great, that which is baked and unbaked,

<p>Then the Teacher, said something more:</p>

<hr>
<p class="verse">"Well-matured, decayed, with little of my life remaining,
<br>Having abandoned rebirth I will go, having made myself a refuge.
<br>Be heedful, mindful, and virtuous, monks,
<br>With well-reasoned thoughts, protect your minds.</p>

<p class="verse">Whoever in this Teaching and Discipline
<br>will live heedful,
<br>Having given up the round of rebirths,
<br>he will put an end to suffering."</p>

<p class="endsutta">The Third Chapter for Recital is Finished.</p>

<h3>27: The Four Noble Things</h3>

<p id="p56"><span class="parno">56</span>Then the Gracious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. After walking for alms in Vesālī, when he was returning from the alms-round after the meal, after looking at Vesālī with an elephant's look,<span class="note" id="n415"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.415] Buddhas, like elephants, apparently turn the whole body round to look back!</span></span></span> he addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "This is the last time, Ānanda, there will be sight of Vesālī for the Realised One. Come Ānanda let us approach Bhaṇḍagāma."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One.</p>

<p>Then the Gracious One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Bhaṇḍagāma. There the Gracious One lived near Bhaṇḍagāma.</p>

<p>There the Gracious One said this to the monks: "Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration, monks, of four things both you and I have been wandering and running along in Saṁsāra for a long time.</p>

<hr>
<p>Which four?</p>

<p>Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration of Noble Virtue both you and I have been wandering and running along in Saṁsāra for a long time.</p>

<p>Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration of Noble Concentrated Development both you and I have been wandering and running along in Saṁsāra for a long time.</p>

<p>Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration of Noble Wisdom both you and I have been wandering and running along in Saṁsāra for a long time.</p>

<p>Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration of Noble Freedom<span class="note" id="n416"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.416] The usual triad of morality, concentration and wisdom, with the outcome, which is liberation.</span></span></span> both you and I have been wandering and running along in Saṁsāra for a long time.</p>

<p>But now this Noble Virtue has been understood and penetrated, this Noble Concentrated Development has been understood and penetrated, this Noble Wisdom has been understood and penetrated, this Noble Freedom has been understood and penetrated. Craving for continued existence has been cut off, what leads to rebirth has been exhausted, there is no continuation in existence."</p>

<hr>
<p>The Gracious One said this, and after saying this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, said something more:</p>

<p class="verse">"Virtue, Concentrated Development, Wisdom, and unsurpassed Freedom,
<br>These things have been understood by the Famous Gotama,</p>

<p class="verse">Thus after knowing it deeply the Buddha declared the Teaching to the monks,
<br>The Suffering-Ender, the Teacher, the Visionary One who is Emancipated."</p>

<p>There also the Gracious One, while living in Bhaṇḍagāma, spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, saying:</p>

<hr>
<p>"Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom, when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration, when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom, when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants, that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of craving for continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance."</p>

<h3>28: The Four Great Referalls</h3>

<p id="p57"><span class="parno">57</span>Then the Gracious One, after living near Bhaṇḍagāma for as long as he liked, addressed venerable Ānanda, saying:</p>

<p>"Come Ānanda let us approach Hatthigāma Elephant Village, Ambagāma Mango Village, Jambugāma Rose-Apple Village, Bhoganagara Wealthy Village."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Bhoganagara. There the Gracious One lived near Bhoganagara at the Joyous Shrine.</p>

<p>There the Gracious One addressed the monks, saying: "I will teach these Four Great Referrals, monks, listen to it, apply your minds well, and I will speak."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," those monks replied to the Gracious One, and the Gracious One said this:</p>

<hr>
<p id="p58"><span class="parno">58</span>"Here, monks, a monk might speak like this: 'I have heard this directly from the Gracious One, friends, directly I learned it: "This is the Teaching, this is the Discipline, this is the Teacher's Dispensation."' That monk's speech, monks, is not to be rejoiced over, not to be scorned at. Without having rejoiced over it, without having scorned it, after learning those words and syllables well, they should be laid alongside the Discourses, they should be compared with the Discipline.</p>

<p>If, when these are laid alongside the Discourses, compared with the Discipline, they do not fit in with the Discourses, they do not compare well with the Discipline, you may here come to this conclusion: 'Certainly this is not the Gracious One's word, it is not well learned by that monk,' and, monks, you should abandon it. If when these are laid alongside the Discourses, compared with the Discipline, they do fit in with the Discourses, they do compare well with the Discipline, you may come to this conclusion: 'Certainly this is the Gracious One's word, it is well-learned by that monk.' This, monks, is the first Great Referral you should bear in mind. (1)</p>

<p>Here, monks, a monk might speak like this: 'In a certain dwelling place lives a Community with elders and leaders, I have heard this directly from that Community, directly I learned it: "This is the Teaching, this is the Discipline, this is the Teacher's Dispensation."' Those monks' speech, monks, is not to be rejoiced over, not to be scorned at. Without having rejoiced over it, without having scorned it, after learning those words and syllables well, they should be laid alongside the Discourses, they should be compared with the Discipline.</p>

<p>If, when these are laid alongside the Discourses, compared with the Discipline, they do not fit in with the Discourses, they do not compare well with the Discipline, you may here come to this conclusion: 'Certainly this is not the Gracious One's word, it is not well learned by that Community,' and, monks, you should abandon it. If when these are laid alongside the Discourses, compared with the Discipline, they do fit in with the Discourses, they do compare well with the Discipline, you may here come to this conclusion: 'Certainly this is the Gracious One's word, it is well-learned by that Community.' This, monks, is the second Great Referral you should bear in mind. (2)</p>

<p>Here, monks, a monk might speak like this: 'In a certain dwelling place live many elders, very learned, who have learned the traditions, who are bearers of the Teaching, bearers of the Discipline, bearers of the Tabulation, I have heard this directly from those elders, directly I learned it: "This is the Teaching, this is the Discipline, this is the Teacher's Dispensation."' Those monks' speech, monks, is not to be rejoiced over, not to be scorned at. Without having rejoiced over it, without having scorned it, after learning those words and syllables well, they should be laid alongside the Discourses, they should be compared with the Discipline.</p>

<p>If, when these are laid alongside the Discourses, compared with the Discipline, they do not fit in with the Discourses, they do not compare well with the Discipline, you may here come to this conclusion: 'Certainly this is not the Gracious One's word, it is not well learned by those elders,' and, monks, you should abandon it. If when these are laid alongside the Discourses, compared with the Discipline they do fit in with the Discourses, they do compare well with the Discipline, you may here come to this conclusion: 'Certainly this is the Gracious One's word, it is well-learned by those elders.' This, monks, is the third Great Referral you should bear in mind. (3)</p>

<p>Here, monks, a monk might speak like this: 'In a certain dwelling place lives one elder, very learned, who has learned the traditions, a bearer of the Teaching, a bearer of the Discipline, a bearer of the Tabulation, I have heard this directly from that elder, directly I learned it: "This is the Teaching, this is the Discipline, this is the Teacher's Dispensation."' That monk's speech, monks, is not to be rejoiced over, not to be scorned at. Without having rejoiced over it, without having scorned it, after learning those words and syllables well, they should be laid alongside the Discourses, they should be compared with the Discipline.</p>

<hr>
<p>If, when these are laid alongside the Discourses, compared with the Discipline they do not fit in with the Discourses, they do not compare well with the Discipline, you may here come to this conclusion: 'Certainly this is not the Gracious One's word, it is not well learned by that elder,' and, monks, you should abandon it. If when these are laid alongside the Discourses, compared with the Discipline, they do fit in with the Discourses, they do compare well with the Discipline, you may here come to this conclusion: 'Certainly this is the Gracious One's word, it is well-learned by that elder.' This, monks, is the fourth Great Referral you should bear in mind. (4)</p>

<hr>
<p>These, monks, are the Four Great Referrals you should bear in mind."</p>

<p>There also the Gracious One, while living near Bhoganagara at the Joyful Shrine, spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, saying:</p>

<p>"Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom, when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration, when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom, when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants, that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of craving for continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance."</p>

<h3>29: The Last Meal</h3>

<p id="84"><span class="parno">59</span>Then the Gracious One, after living near Bhoganagara for as long as he liked, addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Come Ānanda let us approach Pāvā."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Pāvā. There the Gracious One lived near Pāvā in Cunda the Smith's mango wood.</p>

<p>Cunda the Smith heard: "The Gracious One, it seems, has arrived at Pāvā, and is dwelling near Pāvā, in my mango wood." Then Cunda the Smith approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While Cunda the Smith was sitting on one side the Gracious One instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered him with a talk about the Teaching. Then Cunda the Smith, having been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Gracious One with a talk about the Teaching, said this to the Gracious One: "May the Gracious One consent, reverend Sir, to me offering him a meal on the morrow, together with the Community of monks."</p>

<p>The Gracious One consented by maintaining silence. Then Cunda the Smith, having understood the Gracious One's consent, after rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, went away.</p>

<hr>
 <p>Then after the night had passed, Cunda the Smith, in his own residence, having had excellent foodstuffs made ready, and an abundance of tender pork,<span class="note" id="n417"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.417] I have chosen this ambiguous expression to translate the controversial term <i>sūkara-maddava</i> (<i>sūkara</i> = ‘pig’, <i>maddava</i> = ‘mild, gentle, soft’, also ‘withered’). It could therefore mean either ‘the tender parts of a pig’ or ‘what pigs enjoy’ (cf. note 46 in LDB). What is quite clear is that the old commentators did not know for certain what it did mean. DA gives three possibilities: 1. The flesh of a wild pig, neither too young nor too old, which had come to hand without being killed, 2. soft boiled rice cooked with ‘the five products of the cow’, or 3. a kind of elixir of life (<i>rasāyana</i>) (cf. next note). Modem interpreters from RD onwards have favoured truffles as a plausible explanation, and some evidence for this has been adduced. Trevor Ling, in note 31 to his revision of the RD translation of this Sutta (<i>The Buddhaʹs Philosophy of Man</i>; Everyman’s Library, London 1981, p. 218), remarks: ‘This explanation seems intended to avoid offence to vegetarian readers or hearers. Rhys Davids’s statement that Buddhists “have been mostly vegetarians, and are increasingly so”, is difficult to accept.’ Be that as it may (and in fact Eastern Theravada Buddhists have rarely been vegetarians, though some are now, almost certainly under Western influence!), the question of vegetarianism has frequently been raised in the Buddhist field.
<br class="half">The standard Theravada position is set out in the Jivaka Sutta (<a href="../mn/mn55.html">MN&nbsp;55</a>), in which the Buddha tells Jivaka that monks must not eat the meat of any animal concerning which they have seen, heard or suspect that it was specially killed for them. The Buddha rejected Devadatta’s proposal to forbid meat-eating altogether to the monks. Living on alms as they did in the conditions of rural India at the time, they would either have gravely embarrassed those who offered them food, or starved if they had refused all meat. At the same time, under modem conditions, especially in the West, the question does arise as to whether the Saṅgha might not educate the laity into offering only vegetarian food. Many Western Buddhists (and not only Mahayanists) are in fact vegetarians today.
<br class="half">In many schools of Mahayana Buddhism, vegetarianism is the rule, and some writers have indulged in polemics against the Theravada school on this score. This, whatever may be said, has not always been purely for reasons of compassion. Shinran Shōnin, the founder of the Shin School in Japan, abolished compulsory vegetarianism along with celibacy because he considered it a form of penitential practice.</span></span></span> had the time announced to the Gracious One, saying: "It is time, reverend Sir, the meal is ready."</p>

<hr>
<p>Then the Gracious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, together with the Community of monks, approached Cunda the Smith's residence, and after approaching, he sat down on the prepared seat. Having sat down, the Gracious One addressed Cunda the Smith, saying:</p>

<p>"Serve me with the tender pork you have prepared, Cunda, but serve the Community of monks with the other foodstuffs which have been prepared."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir", said Cunda the Smith, and after replying to the Gracious One, he served the Gracious One with the tender pork that had been prepared, but served the Community of monks with the other foodstuffs which had been prepared. Then the Gracious One addressed Cunda the Smith, saying:</p>

<p>"Throw that left over tender pork into a pit, Cunda, for I do not see, Cunda, in the world with its Divinities, Māra, and Brahmā, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, princes and men, one who, having eaten it, could completely digest it, except for a Realised One."<span class="note" id="n418"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.418] The reference to an elixir noted above is interesting. E. Lamotte, <i>The Teaching of Vimalakīrti</i> (Engl. transl., PTS, London 1976), p. 313f., has an interesting and learned note in which he refers to deities mentioned in <a href="../mn/mn36.html">MN&nbsp;36</a>, who offered to insert a special divine essence into the Bodhisatta’s pores to keep him alive, at the time of his extreme austerities. He compares the Buddha’s last meal with the wondrous food served to the Bodhisattvas by Vimalakirti, which takes seven days to digest, whereas the sūkara-maddava eaten by the Buddha can only be digested by the Tathagata (or so we are told). The trouble was, of course, that in fact even the Tathagata failed to digest it! Cf. also <a href="../sn/sn7.9,html">SN&nbsp;7.9</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir", said Cunda the Smith, and after replying to the Gracious One, and throwing what was left over of that tender pork into a pit, he approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side.</p>

<p>While sitting on one side Cunda the Smith having been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Gracious One with a talk about the Teaching, having risen from the seat, went away.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p60"><span class="parno">60</span>Then for the Gracious One, after eating Cunda the Smith's food, a painful affliction arose, bloody dysentery, and strong feelings occurred, such as end in death. There the Gracious One, mindfully, with full awareness, bore those pains without being troubled. Then the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Come, Ānanda, let us approach Kusinārāā."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir", venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One.</p>

<p class="verse">"Having eaten Cunda the Smith's food, so I have heard,
<br>The Firm One experienced a very strong affliction, such as ends in death.</p>

<p class="verse">For the Teacher, who had eaten tender pork,
<br>A very strong sickness arose.
<br>While still purging the Gracious One said:
<br>'I will go to the town of Kusinārāā.'"<span class="note" id="n419"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.419] ‘These verses were made by the elders who held the Council’ (DA), and likewise at verses 38, 41.</span></span></span></p>

<h3>30: Bringing Drinking Water</h3>

<p id="p61"><span class="parno">61</span>Then the Gracious One, having gone down from the road, approached the root of a certain tree, and after approaching, he addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Come now, Ānanda, prepare the outer robe folded in four for me, I am weary, Ānanda, and will sit down."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir", said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One, he prepared the outer robe folded in four, and the Gracious One sat down on the prepared seat. While sitting the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Come now, Ānanda, bring drinking water, I am thirsty, Ānanda, and will drink."</p>

<p>After that was said, venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: "Just now, reverend Sir, five hundred wagons have passed by, and the little water that flows, having been churned by the wheels, is stirred up and disturbed. The Kakutthā river is not far away, with transparent water, agreeable water, cool water, pure water, with beautiful banks, a delightful place, there the Gracious One can drink drinking water, and can cool his limbs."</p>

<p>For a second time the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Come now, Ānanda, bring drinking water, I am thirsty, Ānanda, and will drink."</p>

<p>For a second time venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: "Just now, reverend Sir, five hundred wagons have passed by, and the little water that flows, having been churned by the wheels, is stirred up and disturbed. The Kakutthā river is not far away, with transparent water, agreeable water, cool water, pure water, with beautiful banks, a delightful place, there the Gracious One can drink drinking water, and can cool his limbs."</p>

<p>For a third time the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Come now, Ānanda, bring drinking water, I am thirsty, Ānanda, and will drink."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir", said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One, and taking the bowl, he approached the little river. Then that little river that was flowing, which had been churned by the wheels, and was stirred up and disturbed, as venerable Ānanda was approaching, flowed transparent, clear, and undisturbed.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to venerable Ānanda: "Surely it is wonderful, surely it is marvellous, the Realised One's great power and great majesty, in that that little river that is flowing, which has been churned by wheels, and is stirred up and disturbed, as I was approaching, flowed transparent, clear, and undisturbed."</p>

<p>After taking a bowl of drinking water he approached the Gracious One, and after approaching, he said this to the Gracious One: "It is wonderful, reverend Sir, it is marvellous, reverend Sir, the Realised One's great power and great majesty, in that that little river that is flowing, which has been churned by wheels, and is stirred up and disturbed, as I was approaching, flowed transparent, clear, and undisturbed. Please drink the drinking water, Gracious One! Please drink the drinking water, Fortunate One!" Then the Gracious One drank the water.</p>

<h3>31: The Story concerning Pukkusa Mallaputta</h3>

<p id="p62"><span class="parno">62</span>Now at that time Pukkasa Mallaputta, a disciple of Āḷāra Kālāma,<span class="note" id="n420"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.420] The first teacher the future Buddha went to: see <a href="../mn/mn26.html">&nbsp;26</a>.</span></span></span> was travelling along the highway from Pāvā to Kusinārāā. Pukkasa Mallaputta saw the Gracious One sitting at the root of a certain tree. And having seen him he approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sitting on one side Pukkasa Mallaputta said this to the Gracious One: "It is wonderful, reverend Sir, it is marvellous, reverend Sir, that those who have gone forth, reverend Sir, live such a peaceful living.</p>

<p>Formerly, reverend Sir, Āḷāra Kālāma descended from the highway he was travelling along, and was dwelling for the day sat not far away at the root of a certain tree. Then, reverend Sir, about five hundred waggons passed by very close to Āḷāra Kālāma. Then, reverend Sir, a certain man who was traveling along behind those waggons approached Āḷāra Kālāma, and after approaching he said this to Āḷāra Kālāma:</p>

<p>'Did you not see, reverend Sir, about five hundred waggons pass by?'</p>

<p>'I did not see, friend.'</p>

<p>'But, reverend Sir, did you not hear the sound?'</p>

<p>'I did not hear the sound, friend.'</p>

<p>'But, reverend Sir, were you sleeping?'</p>

<p>'I was not sleeping, friend.'</p>

<p>'But, reverend Sir, were you conscious?'</p>

<p>'Yes, friend.'</p>

<p>'So you, reverend Sir, though conscious and awake, when about five hundred waggons passed by very close neither saw them nor heard a sound! Why, reverend Sir, even your double-robe is covered with dust!'</p>

<p>'Yes, friend.'</p>

<hr>
<p>Then this occurred to that man: 'It is wonderful, it is marvellous, that those who have indeed gone forth live such a peaceful living. Because though conscious and awake, when about five hundred waggons passed by very close he did not see them or hear a sound!' And having gained great confidence in Āḷāra Kālāma, he left."</p>

<p id="p63"><span class="parno">63</span>"Now what do you think, Pukkusa, which is the more difficult to do or the more difficult to come by: that someone though conscious and awake, when about five hundred waggons passed by very close should neither see them nor hear a sound, or that someone, though conscious and awake, when the Divinities rain down, when the Divinities throw it down, and the lightning flashes, and the thunder crashes forth, should neither see it nor hear a sound?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Why, reverend Sir, what to make of five-hundred waggons, six-hundred waggons, seven-hundred waggons, eight-hundred waggons, nine-hundred waggons, one thousand waggons, or one-hundred thousand waggons? This is the more difficult to do or the more difficult to come by: that someone, though conscious and awake, when the Divinities rain down, when the Divinities throw it down, and the lightning flashes, and the thunder crashes forth, should neither see it nor hear a sound."</p>

<hr>
<p>"One day, Pukkusa, I was living near Ātumā at the Decorated House. Now at that time the Divinities rained down, the Divinities threw it down, and the lightning flashed, and the thunder crashed forth, and not far away from the Decorated House two brothers who were farmers died, along with four oxen. Then, Pukkusa, a great crowd of people having departed from Ātumā, went to the place where the brothers who were farmers and the four oxen had died.</p>

<p>Then, Pukkusa, at that time, after leaving the Decorated House, I was walking in the open air near the gate to the Decorated House. Then, Pukkusa, a certain man from that crowd approached me, and after approaching and worshipping me, he stood on one side. While standing there, Pukkusa, I said to that man:</p>

<p>'Why, friend, has that great crowd of people assembled?'</p>

<p>'Just now, reverend Sir, the Divinities rained down, the Divinities threw it down, and the lightning flashed, and the thunder crashed forth, and two brothers who were farmers died, along with four oxen, and that great crowd of people assembled here. But where were you, reverend Sir?'</p>

<p>'I was right here, friend.'</p>

<p>'But, reverend Sir, did you see it?'</p>

<p>'I did not see, friend.'</p>

<p>'But, reverend Sir, did you hear the sound?'</p>

<p>'I did not hear the sound, friend.'</p>

<p>'But, reverend Sir, were you sleeping?'</p>

<p>'I was not sleeping, friend.'</p>

<p>'But, reverend Sir, were you conscious?'</p>

<p>'Yes, friend.'</p>

<p>'So, reverend Sir, though conscious and awake when the Divinities rained down, when the Divinities threw it down, and the lightning flashed, and the thunder crashed forth, you neither saw it, nor heard a sound!'</p>

<p>'Yes, friend.'</p>	

<hr>
<p id="p64"><span class="parno">64</span>Then, Pukkusa, this occurred to that man: 'It is wonderful, it is marvellous, that those who have indeed gone forth live such a peaceful living. Because though conscious and awake when the Divinities rained down, when the Divinities threw it down, and the lightning flashed, and the thunder crashed forth, he did not see it or hear a sound!' And after gaining great confidence in me, worshipping and circumamblating me, he left."</p>

<hr>
<p>After this was said, Pukkusa Mallaputta said this to the Gracious One: "That faith, reverend Sir, I have in Āḷāra Kālāma, I clear away as with a great wind, I wash it away as with a fast-flowing river:</p>

<hr>
<p>Excellent, reverend Sir! Excellent, reverend Sir! Just as, reverend Sir, one might set upright what has been overturned, or open up what has been closed, or show a path to one who is lost, or bear an oil lamp in the darkness so that one who has eyes can see forms, just so has the Teaching been made clear by the Gracious One in more than one way. I go to the Gracious One, reverend Sir, for refuge, and to the Teaching, and to the Community of monks. Please bear it in mind, Gracious One, that I am a lay disciple who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as I am furnished with life."</p>

<hr>
<p>Then Pukkusa Mallaputta addressed a certain man, saying: "Come, my man, bring me a pair of polished gold-coloured robes, ready to wear."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," said that man, and after replying to Pukkusa Mallaputta, he brought a pair of polished gold-coloured robes, ready to wear. Then Pukkusa Mallaputta offered that pair of polished gold-coloured robes, ready to wear, to the Gracious One, saying: "Please accept, reverend Sir, this pair of polished gold-coloured robes, ready to wear out of compassion for me, Gracious One."</p>

<p>"Then, Pukkusa, clothe me with one, and Ānanda with the other."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," said Pukkusa Mallaputta, and after replying to the Gracious One clothed the Gracious One with one, and Ānanda with the other.<span class="note" id="n421"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.421] This ridiculous story is probably a late insertion.</span></span></span> Then the Gracious One instructed Pukkusa Mallaputta roused, enthused, and cheered him with a talk about the Teaching. Then Pukkusa Mallaputta, having been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Gracious One with a talk about the Teaching, after rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, departed.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p65"><span class="parno">65</span>Then, venerable Ānanda, not long after Pukkusa Mallaputta had departed, offered that pair of polished gold-coloured robes, ready to wear, to the Gracious One, and when placed on the Gracious One's body they appeared to have lost their gleam.</p>

<p>Then venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: "It is wonderful, reverend Sir, it is marvellous, reverend Sir, how pure and clean is the Realised One's skin-colour, reverend Sir! This pair of polished gold-coloured robes, ready to wear, reverend Sir, when placed on the Gracious One's body have lost their gleam!"</p>

<p>"Just so, Ānanda, on two occasions, Ānanda, the Realised One's skin-colour becomes exceedingly pure and clean.</p>

<hr>
<p>On which two occasions?</p>

<p>That night, Ānanda, the Realised One perfectly awakens to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening, and that night the Realised One is Finally Emancipated in the Emancipation-element which has no basis for attachment remaining. On these two occasions the Realised One's skin-colour is exceedingly pure and clean. Today, Ānanda, during the last watch of the night, near to Kusinārāā, in the Mallas' Sal Wood at Upavattana, between a pair of Sal trees will be the Realised One's Final Emancipation.</p>

<p>"Come Ānanda let us approach River Kakutthā."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One.<span class="note" id="n422"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.422] The river Ananda had previously mentioned.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p class="verse">"A pair of polished gold-coloured robes was offered by Pukkusa,
<br>Once clothed with it the Teacher's golden skin colour shone forth."</p>

<h3>32: Cunda's Great Gain</h3>

<p id="p66"><span class="parno">66</span>Then the Gracious One with a great Community of monks went to the river Kakutthā, and after going, and entering into the river Kakutthā, bathing, and drinking, and coming back out, he approached the mango wood, and after approaching, he addressed venerable Cundaka, saying: "Come now, Cundaka, prepare the outer robe folded in four for me, I am weary, Cundaka, and will lie down."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir", said venerable Cundaka, and after replying to the Gracious One, he prepared the outer robe folded in four. Then the Gracious One, lay down on his right side in the lion's posture, after placing one foot on the top of the other, mindfully, with full awareness, having applied his mind to the thought of rising. And venerable Cundaka sat down right there in front of the Gracious One.</p>

<p class="verse">"The Awakened One, having gone to the little river Kakutthā,
<br>Which had water that was transparent, pleasant, and clear,
<br>The Teacher, very weary, entered the river,
<br>the Realised One, who is unmatched here in the world.</p>

<p class="verse">After washing and drinking, the Teacher came out,
<br>And in the middle of the Community of monks, at the front,
<br>The Teacher, the Gracious One, having taught the Teaching here,
<br>The Great Sage went to the mango wood.</p>

<p class="verse">He addressed the monk called Cundaka, saying:
<br>"Spread out the robe folded in four for me to lie down on,"
<br>Cunda, urged by the One with Developed Mind,
<br>Very quickly spread the robe folded in four.
<br>The Teacher, very weary, lay down,
<br>With Cunda sat right there at the front."</p>

<p id="p67"><span class="parno">67</span>Then the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "It may be, Ānanda, that someone might cause remorse for the smith Cunda, saying: 'There is no gain for you, friend Cunda, it is a poor gain for you, in that the Realised One, after eating his last almsfood from you, attained Final Emancipation.'</p>

<p>If there is remorse for Cunda the Smith, Ānanda, drive it out in this way, saying: 'There is a gain for you, friend Cunda, it is a good gain for you, in that the Realised One, after eating his last almsfood from you, attained Final Emancipation. I heard this face to face with the Gracious One, friend Cunda, I learned it face to face: 'There are these two almsfoods which have the very same excellent fruit, have the very same excellent result, that is a greater fruit, a greater result than other almsfood.</p>

<hr>
<p>Which two?</p>

<p>That almsfood which, after eating, the Realised One awakens to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening; and that almsfood which, after eating, the Realised One attains Final Emancipation in the Emancipation-element which has no basis for attachment remaining. These are the two almsfoods which have the same fruit, have the same result, that is an exceedingly greater fruit, a greater result than other almsfood.</p>

<p>Friend Cunda the Smith has accumulated a good deed that is conducive to long life, friend Cunda the Smith has accumulated a good deed that is conducive to beauty, friend Cunda the Smith has accumulated a good deed that is conducive to happiness, friend Cunda the Smith has accumulated a good deed that is conducive to fame, friend Cunda the Smith has accumulated a good deed that is conducive to heaven, friend Cunda the Smith has accumulated a good deed that is conducive to sovereignty.' If there is remorse for Cunda the Smith, Ānanda, it should be driven out in this way!"</p>

<hr>
<p>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>

<p class="verse">"For the one who gives merit is increased,
<br>From restraint hatred is not accumulated.
<br>The skilful one gives up what is bad,
<br>Through the destruction of passion, hatred, and delusion, he is emancipated."</p>

<p class="endsection">The Fourth Chapter for Recital is Finished.</p>

<h3>33: Worshipping the Realised One</h3>

<p id="p68"><span class="parno">68</span>Then the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Come Ānanda, let us approach the further shore of the Golden river, to Kusinārāā, and to the Mallas' Sal Wood at Upavattana."<span class="note" id="n423"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.423] Or ‘the recreation-ground (<i>upavattana</i>) belonging to the Mallas’.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One together with a great Community of monks went to the further shore of the Golden river, to Kusinārāā, and the Mallas' Sal Wood at Upavattana, and after going he addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Come, Ānanda, prepare a couch with the head facing north between the Twin Sal Trees for me, I am weary, Ānanda, and will lie down."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One, he prepared a couch with the head facing north between the Twin Sal Trees. Then the Gracious One, lay down on his right side in the lion's posture, after placing one foot on the top of the other, mindfully, with full awareness.</p>

<p>Now at that time the Twin Sal Trees were full of flowering blossoms, outside of flowering time, and they were sprinkling down on the Realised One's body, showering down, pouring down on the Realised One in worship. Also the Divine Coral Tree flowers were falling from the sky, and they were sprinkling down on the Realised One's body, showering down, pouring down on the Realised One in worship. Also Divine sandalwood powder was falling from the sky, and was sprinkling down on the Realised One's body, showering down, pouring down on the Realised One in worship. Also Divine music played in the sky in worship of the Realised One. Also Divine songs played in the sky in worship of the Realised One.</p>

<p id="p69"><span class="parno">69</span>Then the Gracious One said this to venerable Ānanda: "The Twin Sal Trees are full of flowering blossoms, outside of flowering time, and they are sprinkling down on the Realised One's body, showering down, pouring down on the Realised One in worship. Also the Divine Coral Tree flowers are falling from the sky, and they are sprinkling down on the Realised One's body, showering down, pouring down on the Realised One in worship. Also Divine sandalwood powder is falling from the sky, and is sprinkling down on the Realised One's body, showering down, pouring down on the Realised One in worship. Also Divine music plays in the sky in worship of the Realised One. Also Divine songs play in the sky in worship of the Realised One.</p>

<p>But it is not in this way, Ānanda, that the Realised One is honoured, respected, revered, worshipped, or esteemed. But that monk, nun, layman, or laywoman, Ānanda, who lives practising the Teaching in accordance with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching, he honours, respects, reveres, worships, and esteems the Realised One with the highest worship. Therefore, Ānanda, thinking: 'Let us live practising the Teaching in accordance with the Teaching, correct in our practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,' this is how you are to train, Ānanda."</p>

<h3>34: The Visit of the Divinities</h3>

<p id="p70"><span class="parno">70</span>Now at that time venerable Upavāṇa was standing in front of the Gracious One, fanning the Gracious One. Then the Gracious One dismissed venerable Upavāṇa, saying: "Depart, monk, do not stand in front of me."</p>

<p>Then venerable Ānanda thought: "This venerable Upavāṇa has been the Gracious One's attendant for a long time, living near to him, within proximity. Then at the last moment the Gracious One dismisses venerable Upavāṇa, saying: 'Depart, monk, do not stand in front of me.' What was the reason, what was the cause, for the Gracious One dismissing venerable Upavāṇa, saying: 'Depart, monk, do not stand in front of me'?"</p>

<p>Then venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: "This venerable Upavāṇa has been the Gracious One's attendant for a long time, living near to him, within proximity. Then at the last moment the Gracious One dismisses venerable Upavāṇa, saying: 'Depart, monk, do not stand in front of me.' What is the reason, reverend Sir, what is the cause, for the Gracious One dismissing venerable Upavāṇa, saying: 'Depart, monk, do not stand in front of me'?"</p>

<p>"Almost all of the Divinities, Ānanda, from the ten world-elements have assembled to see the Realised One, everywhere around Kusinārāā and the Mallas' Sal Wood at Upavattana for as far as twelve leagues there is no place, even so much as a tip of a pricking hair, unpervaded by powerful Divinities, and the Divinities, Ānanda, are complaining, saying: 'We have come from afar to see the Realised One, only occasionally, infrequently, do Realised Ones, Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world, and today during the last watch of the night will be the Realised One's Final Emancipation, and this powerful monk is stood in front concealing the Realised One, and we are not able to see the Realised One at the last moment.'"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p71"><span class="parno">71</span>"But what beings and Divinities is the Gracious One thinking of?"</p>

<p>"There are, Ānanda, Divinities in the sky, perceiving the Earth, who, having dishevelled hair, are weeping, throwing up their arms, falling down as though cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, they are crying: 'Too quickly the Gracious One will attain Final Emancipation, too quickly the Fortunate One will attain Final Emancipation, too quickly the Visionary in the world will disappear!'</p>

<p>There are, Ānanda, Divinities on the Earth, perceiving the Earth, who, having dishevelled hair, are weeping, throwing up their arms, falling down as though cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, they are crying: 'Too quickly the Gracious One will attain Final Emancipation, too quickly the Fortunate One will attain Final Emancipation, too quickly the Visionary in the world will disappear!'"</p>

<p>But those Divinities who have cut off passion, mindfully, with full awareness, they endure, thinking: 'Impermanent are all processes, how can it be otherwise?'"<span class="note" id="n424"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.424] Normally it is understood that devas are unenlightened, but DA here states—without further comment—that these are Non-Returners or even Arahants.</span></span></span></p>

<h3>35: The Four Places that Produce Enthusiasm</h3>

<p id="p72"><span class="parno">72</span>"Formerly, reverend Sir, the monks, having dwelt for the Rains Retreat used to come to see the Realised One, and we would receive those meditating monks for assembling and seeing the Realised One. But after the Gracious One has passed way, reverend Sir, we will not receive those meditating monks for assembling and seeing the Realised One."</p>

<hr>
<p>"There are these four places that can be seen, that produce enthusiasm,<span class="note" id="n425"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.425] <i>Saṁvejanīyāni:</i> ‘arousing <i>samvega</i>ʹ (‘sense of urgency’: Ñāṇamoli in VM and Pts. translations).</span></span></span> Ānanda, for a faithful man of good family. Which four?</p>

<hr>
<p>Thinking: 'Here the Realised One was born',<span class="note" id="n426"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.426] Lumbini (now Rummindei in Nepal).</span></span></span> Ānanda, that is a place to be seen that produces enthusiasm for a faithful man of good family.</p>

<hr>
<p>Thinking: 'Here the Realised One set rolling the Wheel of the Teaching',<span class="note" id="n428"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.428] The deer-park at Isipatana (modern Sarnāth) near Vārāṇasī (Benares).</span></span></span> Ānanda, that is a place to be seen that produces enthusiasm for a faithful man of good family.</p>

<hr>
<p>These are the four places, Ānanda, that are to be seen that produce enthusiasm for a faithful man of good family.</p>

<hr>
<p>Faithful monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen will come, thinking: 'Here the Realised One was born', 'Here the Realised One awoke to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening', 'Here the Realised One set rolling the Wheel of the Teaching', 'Here the Realised One was Finally Emancipated in the Emancipation-element which has no basis for attachment remaining', and whoever, Ānanda, will die while on pilgrimage to the Shrines with a confident mind they will all, at the break-up of the body, after death, re-arise in a fortunate destiny, in a heavenly world."</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p id="p73"><span class="parno">73</span>"How, reverend Sir, are we to act in regard to women?"</p>

<p>"As though they were not seen, Ānanda."</p>

<p>"But when seeing them, reverend Sir, how are we to act?"</p>

<p>"Without conversing, Ānanda."</p>

<p>"But when conversing, reverend Sir, how are we to act?"</p>

<p>"You should attend to mindfulness, Ānanda."<span class="note" id="n430"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.430] This small passage seems arbitrarily inserted at this point. Cf. <a href="../sn/sn35.127.html">SN&nbsp;35.127</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p74"><span class="parno">74</span>"How should we act, reverend Sir, in regard to the Realised One's body?"</p>

<p>"Do not worry, Ānanda, about how you are to worshipfully dispose of the Realised One's body. Come, Ānanda, live striving for the highest good, being devoted to the highest good, being heedful of the highest good, ardent, and resolute.<span class="note" id="n431"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.431] Lit. ‘for your own good’, but DA says ‘for the highest purpose, Arahantship’. Cf. <a href="#n370">n.370</a>.</span></span></span> There are, Ānanda, wise Nobles, wise brahmins, wise householders who have faith in the Realised One. They will worshipfully dispose of the Realised One's body."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p75"><span class="parno">75</span>"How should we act, reverend Sir, in regard to the Realised One's body?"</p>

<p>"As you act in regard to the Universal Monarch's body, so you should act in regard to the Realised One's body."</p>

<p>"But how do they act, reverend Sir, in regard to the Universal Monarch's body?"</p>

<p>"They wrap the Universal Monarch's body, Ānanda, with clean cloth, and after wrapping with clean cloth, they wrap with carded cotton, and after wrapping with carded cotton, they wrap with clean cloth, by this means after wrapping the Universal Monarch's body with five-hundred pairs of cloth and cotton, enclosing it in an oil tub made of iron,<span class="note" id="n432"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.432] <i>Ayasa</i> means ‘of iron’, but DA, not considering this good enough, glosses it as ‘of gold’: improbable even though, as Ven. Nyāṇaponika notes (LDB, note 53), there is some support in Sanskrit for this meaning.</span></span></span> and enclosing it in another iron tub, and putting it on a scented funeral pyre, they burn the Universal Monarch's body, and they build a Shrine for the Universal Monarch at the crossroads.</p>

<p>So they act in regard to a Universal Monarch's body, and as they act in regard to a Universal Monarch's body so should they act in regard to a Realised One's body, and a Shrine should be made for the Realised One at the crossroads. Whoever there prepares flowers, incense, or powder,<span class="note" id="n433"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.433] Probably sandalwood or ochre paste.</span></span></span> or worships or establishes confidence in his mind, that will be for their benefit and happiness for a long time.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p id="p76"><span class="parno">76</span>These four persons, Ānanda, are worthy of a Shrine. Which four?</p>

</ul>

<hr>
<p>And for what reason or cause is a Realised One, a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha worthy of a Shrine? Thinking: 'This is the Shrine of a Realised One, a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha', Ānanda, many people purify their mind, and after purifying their mind, at the break-up of the body, after death, they arise in a fortunate destiny, in a Heavenly world. This is the reason or cause, Ānanda, why a Realised One, a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha is worthy of a Shrine.</p>

<p>And for what reason or cause is an Individual Sambuddha worthy of a Shrine? Thinking: 'This is the Shrine of a Gracious One, an Individual Sambuddha', Ānanda, many people purify their mind, and after purifying their mind, at the break-up of the body, after death, they arise in a fortunate destiny, in a Heavenly world. This is the reason or cause, Ānanda, why an Individual Sambuddha is worthy of a Shrine.</p>

<p>And for what reason or cause is a Realised One's disciple worthy of a Shrine? Thinking: 'This is the Shrine of a disciple of a Gracious One, a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha', Ānanda, many people purify their mind, and after purifying their mind, at the break-up of the body, after death, they arise in a fortunate destiny, in a Heavenly world.

<p>And for what reason or cause is a Universal Monarch worthy of a Shrine?

<h3>36: Ānanda's Marvellous Qualities</h3>

<p id="p77"><span class="parno">77</span>Then venerable Ānanda, after entering the living place,<span class="note" id="n435"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.435] The word used is <i>vihāra</i> which in the context cannot mean ‘monastery’, and DA calls it a pavilion.

<p>Then the Gracious One addressed the monks, saying: "Where, monks, is Ānanda?"</p>

<p>"This venerable Ānanda, reverend Sir, after entering the living place, and leaning against the door-lintel, stands there crying: 'The Teacher will attain Final Emancipation while I am still a Trainee with much to do, he who has compassion for me!'"</p>

<p>Then the Gracious One addressed a certain monk, saying: "Go, monk, and in my name address Ānanda, saying: 'The Teacher, friend Ānanda, is calling you.'"</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir, and after replying to the Gracious One, he approached venerable Ānanda, and after approaching he said this to venerable Ānanda: "The Teacher, friend Ānanda, is calling you."</p>

<p>"Very well, friend," said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to that monk, he approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sitting on one side the Gracious One said this to venerable Ānanda:</p>

<p>"Enough, Ānanda, don't grieve, don't lament, were you not warned by me when I declared: 'There is alteration in, separation from, and changeability in all that is dear and appealing.' How can it be otherwise, Ānanda, for that which is obtained, born, become, conditioned, subject to dissolution? It is not possible to say this: 'The Realised One's body should not dissolve'.</p>

<p>For a long time, Ānanda, you dwelt near to the Realised One with beneficial, pleasant, trustworthy, and limitlessly friendly bodily actions, with beneficial, pleasant, trustworthy, and limitlessly friendly speech actions, with beneficial, pleasant, trustworthy, and limitlessly friendly mental actions, you have done meritorious deeds, Ānanda, you should devote yourself to quickly striving to be one who is pollutant-free!"<span class="note" id="n437"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.437] An Arahant.

<p>Ānanda is wise, monks, Ānanda is intelligent, monks, he knows: 'This is the time for monks to approach and see the Realised One, this is the time for monks, this is the time for nuns, this is the time for laymen, this is the time for laywomen, this is the time for kings, for kings' ministers, for outside teachers, for the disciples of outside teachers.'</p>

<p>There are four wonderful and marvellous things, monks, about the Universal Monarch. Which four?</p>

<p>If, monks, a group of brahmins … householders … ascetics approach to see the Universal Monarch their minds are uplifted through seeing him, and if the Universal Monarch speaks, their minds are uplifted with the speech, but that group of ascetics are dissatisfied if then the Universal Monarch remains silent.</p>

<p>In the same way there are four wonderful and marvellous things, monks, about Ānanda.</p>

<p>If, monks, a group of monks … nuns … laymen … laywomen<span class="note" id="n438"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.438] This may seem like only one ‘wonderful quality’, but it is fourfold because equally applicable in regard to each of the four groups.</span></span></span> approach to see Ānanda their minds are uplifted through seeing him, and if Ānanda speaks words of welcome, their minds are uplifted with the speech, but that group of laywomen are dissatisfied if at that time Ānanda remains silent.</p>

<p>There are the four wonderful and marvellous things, monks, about Ānanda."</p>

<h3>37: Kusinārāā's History</h3>

<p id="p80"><span class="parno">80</span>After this was said, venerable Ānanda addressed the Gracious One, saying: "Reverend Sir, may the Gracious One not attain Final Emancipation in this small town, this barren town, this branch town. There are, reverend Sir, other great towns, such as: Campā, Rājagaha, Sāvatthī, Sāketa, Kosambī, Bārāṇasī—let the Gracious One attain Final Emancipation there. There are many wealthy Nobles there, wealthy brahmins, wealthy householders, who are devoted to the Realised One, and will worshipfully dispose of the Realised One's body." "Do not say that, Ānanda, do not say that, Ānanda: 'This small town, this barren town, this branch town'.</p>

<p>Formerly, Ānanda, there was a King by the name of Mahāsudassana, a Righteous Monarch, a Righteous King, who was victorious over the four quarters, one who had established a stable country, endowed with the seven jewels.</p>

<hr>
<p>This Kusinārāā, was then named Kusāvatī, and was King Mahāsudassana's capital city. Stretching for twelve leagues from East to West, and seven leagues from North to South, the capital city Kusāvatī was prosperous, Ānanda, successful, populous, full of people, with much food, just as, Ānanda, the capital city of the Divinities named Āḷakamandā<span class="note" id="n439"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.439] Kuvera’s city: see <a href="dn32.html#p43.">DN&nbsp;32.43.</a></span></span></span> is prosperous, successful, populous, full of people, with much food, so the capital city Kusāvatī was prosperous, Ānanda, successful, populous, full of people, with much food.</p>

<p>The capital city Kusāvatī was never separated from the ten sounds, by day or by night, that is to say: the sound of elephants, the sound of horses, the sound of chariots, the sound of drums, the sound of tabours, the sound of lutes, the sound of songs, the sound of cymbals, the sound of hand bells, and with 'eat, drink, chew!' as the tenth sound.<span class="note" id="n440"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.440] Verses 17-18 are repeated practically verbatim in the next Sutta.</span></span></span></p>

<h3>38: The Mallas Worship the Gracious One</h3>

<p id="p81"><span class="parno">81</span>"Go, Ānanda, and after entering into Kusinārāā, announce to the Mallas: 'Today, Vāseṭṭhas,<span class="note" id="n441"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.441] This is the family-name (cf., <a href="dn6.html#n179">n.179</a>).</span></span></span> in the last watch of the night, will be the Realised One's attainment of Final Emancipation, come along, Vāseṭṭhas, come along, Vāseṭṭhas, do not regret it afterwards thinking: "In the area of our village, was the Realised One's attainment of Final Emancipation, and we did not, in the last watch of the night, get to see the Realised One"'."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One, dressing, and taking his robes and bowl, he entered Kusinārāā with a companion.</p>

<p>Now at that time the Mallas from Kusinārāā were assembled in the Council Hall having some business or other. Then venerable Ānanda went to where the Mallas from Kusinārāā were assembled in the Council Hall, and after approaching he said this to the Mallas: "Today, Vāseṭṭhas, in the last watch of the night, will be the Realised One's attainment of Final Emancipation, come along, Vāseṭṭhas, come along, Vāseṭṭhas, do not regret it afterwards thinking: 'In the area of our village, was the Realised One's attainment of Final Emancipation, and we did not, in the last watch of the night, get to see the Realised One.'"</p>

<hr>
<p>After hearing this from venerable Ānanda, the Mallas, the sons of the Mallas, the daughters-in-law of the Mallas, and the wives of the Mallas became miserable, depressed, with their minds given over to suffering. Some, having dishevelled hair, were weeping, throwing up their arms, falling down as though cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, they were crying: "Too quickly the Gracious One will attain Final Emancipation, too quickly the Fortunate One will attain Final Emancipation, too quickly the Visionary in the world will disappear!"</p>

<p>Then the Mallas, the sons of the Mallas, the daughters-in-law of the Mallas, and the wives of the Mallas, miserable, depressed, with their minds given over to suffering, approached the Mallas' Sal Wood at Upavattana, and approached venerable Ānanda.</p>

<p>Then this occurred to venerable Ānanda: "If I make the Mallas of Kusinārāā worship the Gracious One one by one before the Gracious One has been worshipped by the Mallas of Kusinārāā the night will end. Now what if I, having segregated the Mallas family by family, made them worship the Gracious One, saying: 'A Malla named so and so, together with his children, wife, dependents, and councillors worships the Gracious One's feet with his head'?"</p>

<p>Then venerable Ānanda having segregated the Mallas family by family, made them worship the Gracious One, saying: "A Malla named so and so, together with his children, wife, dependents, and councillors worships the Gracious One's feet with his head."</p>

<p>Then venerable Ānanda, in this way, during the first watch of the night, made the Mallas of Kusinārāā worship the Gracious One.</p>

<h3>39: Subhadda, the Last Direct Disciple</h3>

<p id="p82"><span class="parno">82</span>Now at that time a wanderer named Subhadda had arrived at Kusinārāā. The wanderer Subhadda heard: "Today, it seems, in the last watch of the night, will be the ascetic Gotama's attainment of Final Emancipation."</p>

<p>Then this occurred to the wanderer Subhadda: "I have heard this from old, elderly wanderers, who are teachers and teachers' teachers, when they said: 'Only occasionally, rarely, do Realised Ones, Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world.' Today, in the last watch of the night, will be the ascetic Gotama's attainment of Final Emancipation. There is a doubt that has arisen for me, and I have confidence in the ascetic Gotama thus: 'The ascetic Gotama is able to teach the Teaching in such a way that I will be able to abandon that doubt.'"</p>

<p>Then the wanderer Subhadda approached the Mallas' Sal Wood at Upavattana, and approached venerable Ānanda, and after approaching he said to venerable Ānanda: "I have heard this from old, elderly wanderers, dear Ānanda, who are teachers and teachers' teachers, when they said: 'Only occasionally, rarely, do Realised Ones, Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world.' Today, in the last watch of the night, will be the ascetic Gotama's attainment of Final Emancipation. There is a doubt that has arisen for me, and I have confidence in the ascetic Gotama thus: 'The ascetic Gotama is able to teach the Teaching in such a way that I will be able to abandon that doubt'. It would be well, dear Ānanda, if I was allowed to see the ascetic Gotama."</p>

<hr>
<p>After this was said, venerable Ānanda said this to the wanderer Subhadda: "Enough, friend Subhadda, do not trouble the Realised One, the Gracious One is exhausted."</p>

<p>For a second time … third time the wanderer Subhadda said this to venerable Ānanda: "I have heard this from old, elderly wanderers, dear Ānanda, who are teachers and teachers' teachers, when they said: 'Only occasionally, rarely, do Realised Ones, Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world.' Today, in the last watch of the night, will be the ascetic Gotama's attainment of Final Emancipation. There is a doubt that has arisen for me, and I have confidence in the ascetic Gotama thus: 'The ascetic Gotama is able to teach the Teaching in such a way that I will be able to abandon that doubt'. It would be well, dear Ānanda, if I was allowed to see the ascetic Gotama."</p>

<p>For a third time venerable Ānanda said this to the wanderer Subhadda: "Enough, friend Subhadda, do not trouble the Realised One, the Gracious One is exhausted."</p>

<p id="p83"><span class="parno">83</span>The Gracious One heard venerable Ānanda having this conversation with the wanderer Subhadda. Then the Gracious One said this to venerable Ānanda: "Enough, Ānanda, do not obstruct Subhadda allow Subhadda to see the Realised One. Whatever Subhadda will ask of me all of it he will ask of me seeking for deep knowledge,<span class="note" id="n442"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.442] <i>Aññā-pekho:</i> rendered by RD as ‘from a desire for knowledge’, which agrees with DA. But <i>aññā</i> is used for ‘the highest knowledge’, i.e. ‘enlightenment’, and we may assume a play on the two senses (mundane and supramundane) of ‘enlightenment’, equally possible in Pali and in English.</span></span></span> and not to trouble me. Whatever question is put I will answer, and he will quickly understand it."</p>

<hr>
<p>Then venerable Ānanda said this to the wanderer Subhadda: "Go, friend Subhadda, the Gracious One has given you permission."</p>

<p>Then the wanderer Subhadda approached the Gracious One, and after approaching, he exchanged greetings with the Gracious One, and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings, he sat down on one side.</p>

<p>While sitting on one side the wanderer Subhadda said this to the Gracious One: "Those ascetics and brahmins, dear Gotama, who have a community, a group, who teach a group, well-known, famous, religious founders, agreed upon as good for the people, such as: Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta, Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, have they all understood, according to their own avowal? Have they all not understood? Or, have some understood? Or, have some not understood?"</p>

<p>"Enough, Subhadda, stop this: 'Have they all understood, according to their own avowal? Have they all not understood? Or, have some understood? Or, have some not understood?' I will teach the Teaching to you, Subhadda, listen to it, apply your mind well, and I will speak."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," the wanderer Subhadda replied to the Gracious One, and the Gracious One said this:</p>

<p id="p84"><span class="parno">84</span>"Wherever, Subhadda, the Noble Eightfold Path is not found in a Teaching and Discipline there a true ascetic is not found, there a second true ascetic is not found, there a third true ascetic is not found, there a fourth true ascetic is not found.<span class="note" id="n443"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.443] These are, of course, the Stream-Winner, Once-Returner, Non-Returner and Arahant.</span></span></span></p>

<p>But wherever, Subhadda, the Noble Eightfold Path is found in a Teaching and Discipline there a true ascetic is found, there a second true ascetic is found, there a third true ascetic is found, there a fourth true ascetic is found.</p>

<p>In this Teaching and Discipline, Subhadda, the Noble Eightfold Path is found, here a true ascetic is found, here a second true ascetic is found, here a third true ascetic is found, here a fourth true ascetic is found.</p>

<p>Void are the outside doctrines of these other ascetics, Subhadda, but if monks should live well, the world will not be void of Worthy Ones.</p>

<p class="verse">At twenty-nine years, Subhadda,
<br>I went forth a seeker of what is good,
<br>More than fifty years ago,
<br>Wherefore I am truly gone forth, Subhadda.
<br>Existing in the realm of the right Teaching
<br>Outside of this there is no true ascetic,</p>

<p class="verse">a second true ascetic is not found, a third true ascetic is not found,
<br>a fourth true ascetic is not found.
<br>Void are the outside doctrines of these other ascetics,
<br>Subhadda, but if monks should live well,
<br>the world will not be void of Worthy Ones."<span class="note" id="n444"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.444] The PTS text makes the verse run only to line 6, and this is followed by RD and in LDB. But in the addenda to the second edition of 1938, it is indicated that the verse continues as shown here (except, probably, for the line in parentheses), and omitting the name of Subhadda.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p85"><span class="parno">85</span>After this was said, the wanderer Subhadda said this to the Gracious One: "Excellent, reverend Sir! Excellent, reverend Sir! Just as, reverend Sir, one might set upright what has been overturned, or open up what has been closed, or show a path to one who is lost, or bear an oil lamp in the darkness, so that one who has eyes can see forms, just so has the Teaching been made clear by the Gracious One in more than one way. I go to the Gracious One for refuge, reverend Sir, and to the Teaching, and to the Community of monks. May I receive the going-forth, reverend Sir, in the presence of the Gracious One, may I receive the full ordination."</p>

<p>"Those who were formerly of another sect who in this Teaching and Discipline desire the going-forth, who desire full ordination, live on probation for four months, and at the end of four months, the minds of the monks being satisfied,<span class="note" id="n445"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.445] I.e. properly qualified. This passage also at <a href="dn8.html#p.53">DN&nbsp;8.53</a>.</span></span></span> they give the going-forth and the full ordination into the monkhood. But I understand there is a distinction between persons in this case."</p>

<p>"If, reverend Sir, those who were formerly of another sect who in this Teaching and Discipline, desire the going-forth, who desire full ordination, live on probation for four months, and at the end of four months, the minds of the monks being satisfied, they give the going-forth and the full ordination into the monkhood, then I will live on probation for four years, and at the end of four years, the minds of the monks being satisfied, they can give the going-forth and the full ordination into the monkhood."</p>

<p>Then the Gracious One said this to venerable Ānanda: "Then, Ānanda, give the going-forth to Subhadda."</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," venerable Ānanda replied to the Gracious One.</p>

<p>Then the wanderer Subhadda said this to venerable Ānanda: "There are certainly gains for you, friend Ānanda, it is certainly a good gain for you, friend Ānanda, that here, face to face with the Teacher, you have been consecrated with an attendant's consecration."</p>

<p>The wanderer Subhadda received the going forth in the presence of the Gracious One, received full ordination.</p>

<p>Then not long after ordination, venerable Subhadda, while dwelling solitary, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute, after no long time attained that good for which young gentlemen rightly go forth from the house to the houseless life, that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life, and dwelt having known, experienced, and attained it himself in this very life.</p>

<p>Destroyed is rebirth, accomplished is the spiritual life, done is what ought to be done, there is no more of this mundane state—this he knew.</p>

<p>And venerable Subhadda became another of the Worthy Ones. He was the last direct disciple of the Gracious One.<span class="note" id="n446"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.446] Sentence added by the Elders at the Council (DA).</span></span></span></p>

<p class="endsection">The Fifth Chapter for Recital is Finished</p>

<h3>40: The Last Instructions of the Realised One</h3>

<p id="107"><span class="parno">86</span>Then the Gracious One addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "It may be, Ānanda, that some of you may think in this way: 'Past is the Teacher's word, there is now no Teacher for us.' But it should not be seen like that, Ānanda, whatever Teaching and Discipline has been taught by me or laid down, Ānanda, that is your Teacher after my passing away.</p>

<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p>At present, Ānanda, the monks address each other with the word 'friend', but after my passing away they are not to address one another thus. The elder monk, Ānanda, should address the younger monk by his name or by his clan name or by the word 'friend'.<span class="note" id="n447"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.447] <i>Avuso.</i></span></span></span> But the younger monk should address the elder monk as reverend Sir<span class="note" id="n448"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.448] <i>Bhante.</i> Rendered here as ‘Lord’, but in modem usage the normal form of address to monks, rendered ‘Venerable Sir’. Western Buddhists should note that it is a vocative, i.e. used in direct address, and not as a kind of pronoun denoting ‘the Venerable So-and-so’.</span></span></span> or venerable Sir.<span class="note" id="n449"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.449] <i>Āyasmā:</i> the regular prefix as in ‘the Venerable Ananda’, etc.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Desiring to do so, Ānanda, the Community after my passing away, can abolish the minor and subsidiary training rules.<span class="note" id="n450"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.450] The Saṅgha did not take advantage of this permission, mainly because Ananda had omitted to enquire which rules were to be regarded as ‘minor’. It would not be appropriate to get involved here in modem debates on the subject.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p>The highest penalty,<span class="note" id="n451"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.451] <i>Brahmadaṇḍa:</i> used in a different sense at <a href="dn3.html#n156">DN&nbsp;n.156</a>. Channa had been Gotama’s charioteer, and had since joined the Order, but showed a perverse spirit. The treatment imposed on him by the Buddha’s orders brought him to his senses.</span></span></span> Ānanda, after my passing away, is to be handed out to the monk Channa."</p>

<p>"But what is the highest penalty, reverend Sir?"</p>

<p>"The monk Channa, Ānanda, may say whatever he wishes but he is not to be spoken to or advised or instructed by the monks."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p87"><span class="parno">87</span>Then the Gracious One addressed the monks, saying: "It may be, monks, that for one of the monks there is doubt or confusion about the Buddha, or about the Teaching, or about the Community, or about the Path, or about the practice. Ask, monks, do not be regretful later thinking: 'The Teacher was face to face with us and we didn't ask the Gracious One directly about the training.'" After this was said those monks were silent.</p>

<p>For a second time … third time the Gracious One addressed the monks, saying: "It may be, monks, that for one of the monks there is doubt or confusion about the Buddha, or about the Teaching, or about the Community, or about the Path, or about the practice. Ask, monks, do not be regretful later thinking: 'The Teacher was face to face with us and we didn't ask the Gracious One directly about the training.'" For a third time those monks were silent.</p>

<p>Then the Gracious One addressed the monks, saying: "It may be, monks, that out of respect for the Teacher you do not ask, then one friend, monks, can inform another friend about his doubts." After this was said those monks were silent.</p>

<p id="p87a">Then venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: "It is wonderful, reverend Sir, it is marvellous, reverend Sir, I am confident, reverend Sir, that in this Community of monks there is not one of the monks in this Community of monks who has doubt or confusion about the Buddha, or about the Teaching, or about the Community, or about the Path, or about the practice."</p>

<p>"Out of confidence,<span class="note" id="n452"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.452] <i>Pasādā:</i> ‘brightness, serenity of mind’. According to DA ‘the least one’ was Ananda himself.</span></span></span> Ānanda, you speak, but the Realised One, Ānanda, has knowledge that there is not one of the monks in this Community of monks who has doubt or confusion about the Buddha, or about the Teaching, or about the Community, or about the Path, or about the practice. For amongst these five hundred monks, Ānanda, he who is the last monk, is a Stream-Enterer, no longer subject to falling into the lower realms, and has a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening."</p>

<p id="p88"><span class="parno">88</span>Then the Gracious One addressed the monks, saying: "Come now, monks, for I tell you all conditioned things are subject to decay, strive on with heedfulness!" These were the last words of the Realised One.<span class="note" id="n453"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.453] <i>Vayadhammā saṅkhārā. Appamādena sampādetha.</i> The words occurred previously at <a href="dn16.html#p88">DN&nbsp;16.88</a>. RD’s rendering of the latter two words, ‘Work out your salvation with diligence’ (adopted from Warren) has become too famous. Even Brewster, who normally follows RD, has changed it to ‘Accomplish earnestly!’, which is much better. Much has been made in some quarters of the fact that the Sarvastivadin version (and therefore the Tibetan translation) omits these words. But the passage is even expanded in one Chinese version, which makes dubious any conclusions which may be drawn from the omission elsewhere. However, there does seem to have been an early corruption in the text, as in the parallel passage at SN&nbsp;6.2.5.2 the order of the two sentences is reversed: appamādena sampādetha vayadhammā saṅkhādrā (= S i, 158). The inference is that the words quoted were lost at an early stage in the Sarvastivadin tradition. The SN passage probably reflects an intermediate stage in that process.</span></span></span></p>

<h3>41: The Final Emancipation</h3>

<p id="p89"><span class="parno">89</span>Then the Gracious One attained the first absorption, and after emerging from the first absorption he attained the second absorption, and after emerging from the second absorption he attained the third absorption, and after emerging from the third absorption he attained the fourth absorption, and after emerging from the fourth absorption he attained the sphere of endless space, and after emerging from the sphere of endless space he attained the sphere of endless consciousness, and after emerging from the sphere of endless consciousness he attained the sphere of nothingness, and after emerging from the sphere of nothingness, he attained the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, and after emerging from the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, he attained the cessation of perception and feeling.<span class="note" id="n454"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.454] RD says ‘No one, of course, can have known what actually did occur.’ Since Anuruddha is said to have had highly developed psychic powers, we cannot be so sure.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p>Then venerable Ānanda said this to venerable Anuruddha: "Has the Gracious One, reverend Anuruddha, attained Final Emancipation?"</p>

<p>"The Gracious One, reverend Ānanda,<span class="note" id="n455"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.455] Note that Ananda, the junior, addresses Anuruddha as instructed by the Buddha, and Anuruddha replies similarly.</span></span></span> has not attained Final Emancipation, he has attained the cessation of perception and feeling."</p>

<p>Then the Gracious One, after emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling, attained the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, and after emerging from the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception he attained the sphere of nothingness, and after emerging from the sphere of nothingness he attained the sphere of endless consciousness, and after emerging from the sphere of endless consciousness he attained the sphere of endless space, and after emerging from the sphere of endless space he attained the fourth absorption, and after emerging from the fourth absorption he attained the third absorption, and after emerging from the third absorption he attained the second absorption, and after emerging from the second absorption he attained the first absorption, and after emerging from the first absorption he attained the second absorption, and after emerging from the second absorption he attained the third absorption, and after emerging from the third absorption he attained the fourth absorption, and after emerging from the fourth absorption, immediately the Gracious One attained Final Emancipation.</p>

<p>"There are, friend Ānanda, Divinities in the sky, perceiving the Earth, who, having dishevelled hair, are weeping, throwing up their arms, falling down as though cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, crying: 'Too quickly the Gracious One has attained Final Emancipation, too quickly the Fortunate One has attained Final Emancipation, too quickly the Visionary in the world has disappeared!'</p>

<p>There are, friend Ānanda, Divinities on the Earth, perceiving the Earth, who, having dishevelled hair, are weeping, throwing up their arms, falling down as though cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, crying: 'Too quickly the Gracious One has attained Final Emancipation, too quickly the Fortunate One has attained Final Emancipation, too quickly the Visionary in the world has disappeared!' But those Divinities, who have cut off passion, they mindfully, with full awareness, endure, thinking: 'Impermanent are all processes, how can it be otherwise?'"</p>

<p>Then venerable Anuruddha and venerable Ānanda spent the rest of the night in talk about the Teaching.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p96"><span class="parno">96</span>Then venerable Anuruddha addressed venerable Ānanda, saying: "Go, Ānanda, and after entering Kusinārāā inform the Mallas of Kusinārāā, saying: 'The Gracious One has attained Emancipation, Vāseṭṭhas, now is the time for whatever you are thinking.'"</p>

<p>"Very well, reverend Sir," said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to venerable Anuruddha, dressing in the morning time, and taking his robes and bowl, he entered Kusinārāā with a companion.</p>

<h3>42: The Preparation of the Body</h3>

<p>Now at that time the Mallas from Kusinārāā were assembled in the Council Hall having some business or other. Then venerable Ānanda approached the Mallas from Kusinārāā in the Council Hall, and after approaching he informed the Mallas of Kusinārāā saying: "The Gracious One has attained Emancipation, Vāseṭṭhas, now is the time for whatever you are thinking."</p>

<p>After hearing this word from venerable Ānanda, the Mallas, the sons of the Mallas, the daughters-in-law of the Mallas, and the wives of the Mallas became miserable, depressed, with their minds given over to suffering. Some, having dishevelled hair, were weeping, throwing up their arms, falling down as though cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, they were crying: "Too quickly the Gracious One has attained Final Emancipation, too quickly the Fortunate One has attained Final Emancipation, too quickly the Visionary in the world has disappeared!"</p>

<h3>The Buddha's Relics</h3>

<p id="p97"><span class="parno">97</span>Then the Mallas from Kusinārāā ordered their men, saying: "Now, friends, gather together perfume and flowers, and all the musicians in Kusinārāā."</p>

<p>Then the Mallas of Kusinārāā, having taken perfumes and garlands, and all the musicians, and five-hundred pairs of clothes, approached the Mallas' Sal Wood at Upavattana, and the Gracious One's body, after approaching the Gracious One's body, through honouring, respecting, revering, and worshipping the body, with dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes, and making cloth canopies, and preparing circular pavillions, they made the day pass.</p>

<p>Then this occurred to the Mallas of Kusinārāā: "Today it is too late to burn the Gracious One's body, tomorrow we will burn the Gracious One's body."</p>

<p>Then the Mallas of Kusinārāā, through honouring, respecting, revering, and worshipping the Gracious One's body, with dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes, and making cloth canopies, and preparing circular pavillions, they made the second day pass, they made the third day pass, they made the fourth day pass, they made the fifth day pass, they made the sixth day pass.</p>

<hr>
<p>Then on the seventh day this occurred to the Mallas of Kusinārāā: "While honouring, respecting, revering, and worshipping the Gracious One's body, with dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes, after taking it out of the city by the South, on the outside of the City to the South we will burn the Gracious One's body."</p>

<p id="p98"><span class="parno">98</span>Now at that time eight leaders of the Mallas, having washed their heads and put on clean clothes, said: "Let us lift the Gracious One's body," but they were not able to lift it.</p>

<p>Then the Mallas of Kusinārāā said this to venerable Anuruddha: "What is the reason, Anuruddha, what is the cause why eight leaders of the Mallas, having washed their heads and put on clean clothes, and saying: 'Let us lift the Gracious One's body,' are not able to lift it?"</p>

<p>"You Vāseṭṭhas have one intention, and the Divinities have another intention."</p>

<p>"But what is the Divinities' intention, reverend Sir?"</p>

<p>"Your intention, Vāseṭṭhas, is: 'We, while honouring, respecting, revering, and worshipping the Gracious One's body, with dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes, after taking it out of the City by the South, on the outside of the City to the South, will burn the Gracious One's body.'</p>

<p>The Divinities' intention, Vāseṭṭhas, is: 'We, while honouring, respecting, revering, and worshipping the Gracious One's body, with the Divinities' dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes, after carrying it to the North of the City by the North, and re-entering the City by the North Gate, and carrying it to the middle of the City by the middle, and going out by the Eastern Gate, to the East of the City, at the Mallas' Shrine called the Bonded Coronet, there let us burn the Gracious One's body."</p>

<p>"Let us do according to the Divinities' intention, reverend Sir."</p>

<p id="p99"><span class="parno">99</span>Now at that time the whole of Kusinārāā, including the dirty rubbish heaps, was covered knee-deep with Divine Coral Tree flowers. Then the Divinities and the Mallas of Kusinārāā while honouring, respecting, revering, and worshipping the Gracious One's body with the Divinities' and mens' dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes, after carrying it to the North of the City by the North, and re-entering the City by the North Gate, and carrying it to the middle of the City by the middle, and going out by the Eastern Gate, to the East of the City, at the Mallas' Shrine called the Bonded Coronet there set down the Gracious One's body.</p>

<p id="p100"><span class="parno">100</span>Then the Mallas of Kusinārāā said this to venerable Ānanda: "How do we act, reverend Ānanda, in regard to the Realised One's body?"</p>

<p>"As you act, Vāseṭṭhas, in regard to the Universal Monarch's body, so you should act in regard to the Realised One's body."</p>

<p>"But how do we act, reverend Ānanda, in regard to the Universal Monarch's body?"</p>

<p>"They wrap the Universal Monarch's body, Vāseṭṭhas, with clean cloth, and after wrapping with clean cloth, they wrap with carded cotton, and after wrapping with carded cotton, they wrap with clean cloth, by this means after wrapping the Universal Monarch's body with five-hundred pairs of cloth and cotton, enclosing it in an oil tub made of iron, and enclosing it in another iron tub, and putting it on a scented funeral pyre, they burn the Universal Monarch's body, and they build a Shrine for the Universal Monarch at the crossroads.</p>

<p>So they act, Vāseṭṭhas, in regard to a Universal Monarch's body. Just as they act, Vāseṭṭhas, in regard to a Universal Monarch's body, so should they act in regard to a Realised One's body, and a Shrine should be made for the Realised One at the crossroads. Whoever there prepares flowers, incense, or powder, or worships or establishes confidence in his mind, that will be for their benefit and happiness for a long time."</p>

<p>Then the Mallas of Kusinārāā gave orders to their men, saying: "If it is so then wrap the body with the Mallas' carded cloth, friends."</p>

<p>Then the Mallas of Kusinārāā wrapped the Gracious One's body with clean cloth, and after wrapping with clean cloth, they wrapped with carded cotton, and after wrapping with carded cotton, they wrapped with clean cloth, and by this means, after wrapping the Gracious One's body with five-hundred pairs of cloth and cotton, enclosing it in an oil tub made of iron, and enclosing it in another iron tub, and putting it on a scented funeral pyre, they put the Gracious One's body on the funeral pyre.</p>

<h3>43: The Story concerning Mahākassapa</h3>

<p id="p101"><span class="parno">101</span>Now at that time venerable Mahākassapa<span class="note" id="n458"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.458] One of the Buddha’s most eminent disciples, not to be confused with the many other Kassapas. He had great psychic powers and is said to have lived to be more than 120. He presided at the first Council.</span></span></span> was travelling along the highway from Pāvā to Kusinārāā, together with a great Community of monks, around five-hundred monks. Then venerable Mahākassapa, after descending from the path, sat down at the root of a certain tree.</p>

<p>Now at that time a certain Ājīvaka<span class="note" id="n459"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.459] Cf. <a href="dn1.html#n66">n.66.</a></span></span></span> while holding a Mandārava flower from Kusinārāā was travelling along the highway to Pāvā.</p>

<p>Venerable Mahākassapa saw that Ājīvaka approaching from afar, and after seeing him, he said this to that Ājīvaka: "Do you know our Teacher, friend?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, friend, I know. Today is seven days since the Final Emancipation of the ascetic Gotama, therefore I am holding this Mandārava flower."</p>

<p>Then those monks there who were not free from passion, some, throwing up their arms, were weeping, falling down as though cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, they were crying: 'Too quickly the Gracious One has attained Final Emancipation, too quickly the Fortunate One has attained Final Emancipation, too quickly the Visionary in the world has disappeared!'</p>

<p>But those monks who were free from passion, mindfully, with full awareness, endured, thinking: "Impermanent are all processes, how can it be otherwise?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p102"><span class="parno">102</span>Now at that time one who had gone forth in old age, named Subhadda<span class="note" id="n460"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.460] Not, of course, the same person as the Subhadda mentioned at 5.23—30.</span></span></span> was sitting in that group. Then Subhadda, who had gone forth in old age, said this to those monks: "Enough, friends, do not grieve, do not lament, we are now freed from that troublesome Great Ascetic, saying: 'This is allowable for you, this is not allowable for you.' But now we will do whatever we wish, and we will not do whatever we do not wish."</p>

<p>Then venerable Mahākassapa addressed the monks, saying: "Enough, friends, do not grieve, do not lament, were you not warned by the Gracious One, friends, when he declared this: 'There is alteration in, separation from, and changeability in all that is dear and appealing.' How can it be otherwise, friends, for that which is obtained, born, become, in process, subject to dissolution? It is not possible to say this: 'It should not dissolve'.</p>

<p id="p103"><span class="parno">103</span>Now at that time four leaders of the Mallas, having washed their heads and put on clean clothes, said: "Let us burn the Gracious One's funeral pyre," but they were not able to burn it. Then the Mallas of Kusinārāā said this to venerable Anuruddha: "What is the reason, venerable Anuruddha, what is the cause, why four leaders of the Mallas, having washed their heads and put on clean clothes, and saying: 'Let us burn the Gracious One's funeral pyre,' are not able to burn it?"</p>

<p>"The Divinities have another intention, Vāseṭṭhas."</p>

<p>"But what is the Divinities' intention, reverend Sir?"</p>

<p>"The Divinities' intention, Vāseṭṭhas, is: 'The venerable Mahākassapa is travelling along the highway from Pāvā to Kusinārāā together with a great Community of monks, around five-hundred monks, the Gracious One's funeral pyre will not burn while venerable Mahākassapa has not worshipped the Gracious One's feet with his head.'"</p>

<p>"Let us do according to the Divinities' intention, reverend Sir."</p>

<p id="p104"><span class="parno">104</span>Then venerable Mahākassapa approached Kusinārāā, and the Mallas' Shrine called the Bonded Coronet, and the Gracious One's funeral pyre, and after approaching and arranging his robe on one shoulder, extending his hands in respectful salutation, and circumambulating the funeral pyre three times, and uncovering the feet he worshipped the Gracious One's feet with his head.</p>

<p>Also five-hundred monks, after arranging their robes on one shoulder, extending their handsin respectful salutation, and circumambulating the funeral pyre three times, worshipped the Gracious One's feet with their heads. After the Gracious One's feet had been worshipped by venerable Mahākassapa and by five-hundred monks the funeral pyre caught fire by itself.</p>

<p id="p105"><span class="parno">105</span>Now while the Gracious One's body was burning, of the outer skin, the inner skin, the flesh, the sinews, the synovial fluid, neither charcoal was evident, nor was ash of the body left over <span class="add">only the bones remained</span>.<span class="note" id="n461"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.461] <i>Sarīra:</i> bones (later interpreted as the indestructible substance supposed to be found in the ashes of Arahants).</span></span></span> Just as while ghee or oil is burning there is no charcoal and no ash evident, so when the Gracious One"s body was burning, of the outer skin, the inner skin, the flesh, the sinews, the synovial fluid, neither charcoal was evident, nor was ash of the body left over. Only two of those five-hundred pairs of clothes were not consumed, that on the inside and that on the outside.</p>

<p>When the Gracious One's body was burnt a shower of water appeared in the sky, and the Gracious One's funeral pyre was extinguished. Also after water rose from a well (sal tree<span class="note" id="n462"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.462] Some trees are said to have the property of putting out fires. In Japan this is said of the gingko — despite considerable evidence to the contrary!</span></span></span>), the Gracious One's funeral pyre was extinguished. Also the Mallas from Kusinārāā extinguished the Gracious One's funeral pyre with all types of fragrant water.</p>

<p>Then the Mallas of Kusinārāā, after making an enclosure of spears in the Council Hall, and surrounding the Gracious One's bodily relics with bows, honoured, respected, revered, and worshipped it with dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes.</p>

<h3>44: The Distribution of the Relics</h3>

<p id="p106"><span class="parno">106</span>The Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, heard: "The Gracious One, it seems, has attained Final Emancipation in Kusinārāā." Then the Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārāā, saying: "The Gracious One was a Noble, and I also am a Noble, I am worthy of a share of the Gracious One's bodily relics, I will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the bodily relics."</p>

<p>Then the Licchavīs of Vesālī heard: "The Gracious One, it seems, has attained Final Emancipation in Kusinārāā." Then the Licchavīs of Vesālī sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārāā, saying: "The Gracious One was a Noble, and we also are Nobles, we are worthy of a share of the Gracious One's bodily relics, we will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the bodily relics."</p>

<p>Then the Sakyas of Kapilavatthu heard: "The Gracious One, it seems, has attained Final Emancipation in Kusinārāā." Then the Sakyas of Kāpilavatthu sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārāā, saying: "The Gracious One was our foremost relative, we are worthy of a share of the Gracious One's bodily relics, we will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the bodily relics."</p>

<p>Then the Bulas of Allakappa heard: "The Gracious One, it seems, has attained Final Emancipation in Kusinārāā." Then the Bulas of Allakappa sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārāā, saying: "The Gracious One was a Noble, and we also are Nobles, we are worthy of a share of the Gracious One's bodily relics, we will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the bodily relics."</p>

<p>Then the Koliyas of Rāmagāma heard: "The Gracious One, it seems, has attained Final Emancipation in Kusinārāā." Then the Koliyas of Rāmagāma sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārāā, saying: "The Gracious One was a Noble, and we also are Nobles, we are worthy of a share of the Gracious One's bodily relics, we will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the bodily relics."</p>

<p>Then the brahmin Veṭhadīpaka heard: "The Gracious One, it seems, has attained Final Emancipation in Kusinārāā." Then the brahmin Veṭhadīpaka sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārāā, saying: "The Gracious One was a Noble, and I am a brahmin, I am worthy of a share of the Gracious One's bodily relics, I will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the bodily relics."</p>

<p>Then the Mallas of Pāvā heard: "The Gracious One, it seems, has attained Final Emancipation in Kusinārāā." Then the Mallas of Pāvā sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārāā, saying: "The Gracious One was a Noble, and we also are Nobles, we are worthy of a share of the Gracious One's bodily relics, we will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the bodily relics."</p>

<p>After this was said, the Mallas of Kusinārāā said this to their community and group: "The Gracious One has attained Final Emancipation in the area of our village, but we will not see a share of the Gracious One's bodily relics."</p>

<p id="p107"><span class="parno">107</span>After this was said, the brahmin Doṇa said this to their community and group:</p>

<p class="verse">"Listen, dear Sirs, to a sentence of mine:
<br>Our Buddha was one who spoke about forebearance
<br>It is not good that there should be a battle
<br>About sharing the relics of the Best Man.</p>

<p class="verse">Let us united, in concord, dear Sirs,
<br>With joyful minds, make eight shares of the relics,
<br>And set up Shrines in every direction<br>So that many people may gain faith in the Visionary One."</p>

<p id="p108"><span class="parno">108</span>"Now, brahmin, you must divide the Gracious One's bodily relics in eight equal divisions."</p>

<p>"Certainly, dear Sir," said Doṇa the brahmin, after replying to that community and group, and dividing the Gracious One's bodily relics in eight equal divisions, he said this to that community and group: "Please give me this urn, dear Sirs, and I also will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the urn." They gave the urn to Doṇa the brahmin.</p>

<p>Then the Moriyā of Pepper Wood heard: "The Gracious One, it seems, has attained Final Emancipation in Kusinārāā." Then the Moriyā of Pepper Wood sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārāā, saying: "The Gracious One was a Noble, and we also are Nobles, we are worthy of a share of the Gracious One's bodily relics, we will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the bodily relics."</p>

<p>"There are no more portions of the Gracious One's relics, instead take the ashes from the Gracious One's body." Therefore they took away the ashes.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p id="p109"><span class="parno">109</span>Then the Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, made a Shrine for the Gracious One's bodily relics at Rājagaha and held a festival.</p>

<p>The Licchavīs from Vesālī made a Shrine for the Gracious One's bodily relics at Vesālī and held a festival.</p>

<p>The Sakyas from Kapilavatthu made a Shrine for the Gracious One's bodily relics at Kapilavatthu and held a festival.</p>

<p>The Bulas of Allakappa made a Shrine for the Gracious One's bodily relics at Allakappa and held a festival.</p>

<p>The Koliyas of Rāmagāma made a Shrine for the Gracious One's bodily relics at Rāmagāma and held a festival.</p>

<p>The Veṭhadīpaka brahmin made a Shrine for the Gracious One's bodily relics at Veṭṭhadīpa and held a festival.</p>

<p>The Mallas of Kusinārāā made a Shrine for the Gracious One's bodily relics at Kusinārāā and held a festival.</p>

<p>Doṇa the brahmin made a Shrine for the urn and held a festival.</p>

<p>The Moriyās of Pepper Wood made a Shrine for the ashes at Pepper Wood and held a festival.</p>

<p>Thus there were eight Shrines for the bodily relics, the Urn Shrine was the ninth, and the Ashes Shrine was the tenth, and so it was in former times.<span class="note" id="n463"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.463] This seems to have been the original end of the Sutta.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p110" class="verse"><span class="parno">110</span>There were eight measures of the Visionary's relics,
<br>Seven measures are honoured in Jambudīpa,
<br>One measure of the most Noble Man

<p class="verse">One tooth is worshipped in the Heavens,

<p class="verse">Through the power of these relics this Lovely Earth
