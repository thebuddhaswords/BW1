<br>From rightly discerning that greed,

<p id="p1-4" class="verse"><span class="parno">4</span><span class="evam">This, too, was the meaning of what was said by the Blessed One, so I have heard.</span></p>

<p id="p14-2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Monks, I don't envision even one other obstruction — obstructed by which people go wandering and transmigrating on for a long, long time — like the obstruction of ignorance.

<p class="verse" id="p14-3"><span class="parno">3</span>No one other thing so obstructs people that they wander on, day and night, as when they're ensnared with delusion.</p>

<hr>
<p class="verse" id="p15-3"><span class="parno">3</span>With craving his companion, a man wanders on a long, long time. Neither in this state here nor anywhere else does he go beyond the wandering- on.</p>

<p id="p16-1"><span class="parno">1</span><span class="evam">This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</span></p>

<p id="p16-2"><span class="parno">2</span>"With regard to internal factors, I don't envision any other single factor like appropriate attention<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Appropriate attention (yoniso manasikara) is the ability to focus attention on questions that lead to the end of suffering. <a href="../mn/mn2.html#p5">MN2</a> lists the following questions as not fit for attention: "Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past?… Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future?… Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound?" The discourse also lists the following issues as fit for attention: "This is suffering. This is the origination of suffering. This is the cessation of suffering. This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering."</span></span></span> as doing so much for a monk in training,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A person "in training" is one who has attained at least the first level of Awakening, but not yet the final level.</span></span></span> who has not attained the heart's goal but remains intent on the unsurpassed safety from bondage.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Bondage = the four yokes: sensual passion, becoming, views, and ignorance.</span></span></span> A monk who attends appropriately abandons what is unskillful and develops what is skillful.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p16-3"><span class="parno">3</span>Appropriate attention as a quality of a monk in training: nothing else does so much for attaining the superlative goal. A monk, striving appropriately, attains the ending of suffering.</p>

<p id="p17-2"><span class="parno">2</span>"With regard to external factors, I don't envision any other single factor like admirable friendship<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In SN 45.2 the Buddha says, "Admirable friendship … is actually the whole of the holy life … It is in dependence on me as an admirable friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth … aging … death … sorrow, lamentation, pain, suffering, and despair." As AN 8.54 points out, admirable friendship means not only associating with good people, but also learning from them and emulating their good qualities.</span></span></span> as doing so much for a monk in training, who has not attained the heart's goal but remains intent on the unsurpassed safety from bondage.

<p class="verse" id="p17-3"><span class="parno">3</span>A monk with admirable people as friends — who's reverential, respectful, doing what his friends advise — mindful, alert, attains step by step the ending of all fetters.</p>

Which one thing? Schism in the Saṅgha. When the Saṅgha is split, there are arguments with one another, there is abuse of one another, ganging up on one another, abandoning of one another. Then those with little confidence [in the teaching] lose all confidence, while some of those who are confident become otherwise."</p>

<p class="verse" id="p18-3"><span class="parno">3</span>Doomed for an aeon to deprivation, to hell: one who has split the Saṅgha. Delighting in factions, unjudicious — he's barred from safety from bondage. Having split a Saṅgha in concord, he cooks for an aeon in hell.</p>

<p id="p18-4"><span class="parno">4</span><span class="evam">This, too, was the meaning of what was said by the Blessed One, so I have heard.</span></p>

Which one thing? Concord in the Saṅgha. When the Saṅgha is in concord, there are no arguments with one another, no abuse of one another, no ganging up on one another, no abandoning of one another. Then those with little confidence [in the teaching] become confident, while those already confident become even more so."</p>

<p id="p44-3"><span class="parno">3</span>And what is the Unbinding property with fuel remaining? There is the case where a monk is an arahant whose fermentations have ended, who has reached fulfillment, finished the task, laid down the burden, attained the true goal, ended the fetter of becoming, and is released through right gnosis. His five sense faculties still remain and, owing to their being intact, he is cognizant of the agreeable and the disagreeable, and is sensitive to pleasure and pain. His ending of passion, aversion, and delusion is termed the Unbinding property with fuel remaining.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">With fuel remaining (sa-upadisesa) and with no fuel remaining (anupadisesa): The analogy here is to a fire.

While the arahant is still alive, he/she still experiences the five aggregates, but they do not burn with the fires of passion, aversion, or delusion. When the arahant passes away, there is no longer any experience of aggregates here or anywhere else.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p49-2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Overcome by two viewpoints, some human and divine beings adhere, other human and divine beings slip right past, while those with vision see.</p>

<p id="p49-3"><span class="parno">3</span>"And how do some adhere? Human and divine beings enjoy becoming, delight in becoming, are satisfied with becoming. When the Dhamma is being taught for the sake of the cessation of becoming, their minds do not take to it, are not calmed by it, do not settle on it or become resolved on it. This is how some adhere.</p>

<p id="p49-4"><span class="parno">4</span>"And how do some slip right past? Some, feeling horrified, humiliated, and disgusted with that very becoming, relish non-becoming: 'When this self, at the break-up of the body, after death, perishes and is destroyed, and does not exist after death, that is peaceful, that is exquisite, that is sufficiency!' This is how some slip right past.</p>

<p id="p49-5"><span class="parno">5</span>"And how do those with vision see? There is the case where a monk sees what has come into being as come into being. Seeing what has come into being as come into being, he practices for disenchantment with what has come into being, dispassion toward what has come into being, cessation of what has come into being. This is how those with vision see."<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This discourse illustrates, in a technical fashion, the function of appropriate attention presents the same point from a different perspective: "This world takes as its object a polarity, that of existence and non-existence. But when one sees the origination of the world (= the six senses and their objects) as it actually is with right discernment, 'non-existence' with reference to the world does not occur to one. When one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment, 'existence' with reference to the world does not occur to one. By and large, this world is in bondage to attachments, clingings, and biases. But one such as this does not get involved with or cling to these attachments, clingings, fixations of awareness, biases, or obsessions; nor is he resolved on 'my self.' He has no uncertainty or doubt that, when there is arising, only suffering is arising; and that when there is passing away, suffering is passing away. In this, his knowledge is independent of others."</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p76-2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Aspiring to these three forms of bliss, a wise person should guard his virtue. Which three? <span class="add">Thinking,</span> 'May praise come to me,' a wise person should guard his virtue. <span class="add">Thinking,</span> 'May wealth come to me,' a wise person should guard his virtue. <span class="add">Thinking,</span> 'At the break-up of the body, after death, may I reappear in a good destination, in heaven,' a wise person should guard his virtue. Aspiring to these three forms of bliss, a wise person should guard his virtue."</p>

<hr>
<p class="verse" id="p76-3"><span class="parno">3</span>Intelligent, you should guard your virtue, aspiring to three forms of bliss: praise; the obtaining of wealth; and, after death, rejoicing in heaven.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p76-4"><span class="parno">4</span>Even if you do no evil but seek out one who does, you're suspected of evil. Your bad reputation grows.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p76-6"><span class="parno">6</span>The one who's touched, the one who touches another — like an arrow smeared with poison — contaminates the quiver. So, fearing contamination, the enlightened should not be comrades with evil people.</p>

O, that the end of this entire mass of suffering might be known!' But this young man of good family, having gone forth in this way, may be greedy for sensual pleasures, strong in his passions, malevolent in mind, corrupt in his resolves, his mindfulness muddled, unalert, uncentered, his mind scattered, and his faculties uncontrolled. Just as a firebrand from a funeral pyre — burning at both ends, covered with excrement in the middle — is used as fuel neither in a village nor in the wilderness: I tell you that this is a simile for this person.
